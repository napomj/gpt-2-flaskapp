Beekeeping (or apiculture) is the maintenance of bee colonies, commonly in man-made hives, by humans. Most such bees are honey bees in the genus Apis, but other honey-producing bees such as Melipona stingless bees are also kept. A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect their honey and other products that the hive produce (including beeswax, propolis, flower pollen, bee pollen, and royal jelly), to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or "bee yard".

Bees are directly influenced by their environment, therefore, their behavior and success varies greatly across climates. For instance, the busy foraging season for bees will be much longer in the warmer south than it will be in the north.
Familiarize yourself with what beekeeping looks like in your neck of the woods. We recommend joining your local beekeepers club or association, and finding an experienced mentor in your area.

The apiary at the Queens County Farm Museum is now a who’s who of Manhattan rescue bees. They hail from the rooftops of the InterContinental New York Barclay hotel, the Brooks Brothers flagship and the New York Institute of Technology, among other places. The apiary officially opened early last summer, which was perfect timing, since a good portion of New York’s honeybees (many of whom live atop office buildings and hotels across the city) found themselves untended and in limbo during the shutdown. Since New York City legalized beekeeping in 2010, it has grown in popularity. It is a small-space activity; a hive is roughly the size of a two-drawer filing cabinet. There are now bee-focused nonprofits, public parks with pollinator gardens and jars of hyperlocal honey in abundance at green markets. The new apiary in Queens, which has basically handled overflow during the pandemic, shows how bee-crazy New Yorkers have become.
But there is also a growing concern among some scientists that honeybees, most of them imported to the city to feed this beekeeping frenzy, are a threat to New York’s native pollinators, whose dwindling populations could affect local flora and the environment at large.
When the virus slowed our lives down, encouraging us to stay in our homes, enjoy the outdoors and focus on activities in the natural world (like bird-watching or gardening), the zeal for urban beekeeping intensified, too. Sean Flynn, a beekeeper for over five years, took the opportunity to share his passion with his youngest daughter, Alaura, 18.
“I’ve always had this fascination with the hive mentality — it’s about the collective and the greater good,” said Mr. Flynn, who put a hive in his middle daughter’s bedroom when she went off to college six years ago. He kept the windows open in his sixth-story apartment so the bees could come and go as they pleased. The neighbors never noticed.
Mr. Flynn now inspects and monitors 12 different hives in various community gardens across the city. Recently, he captured a swarm outside the Javits Center. Although he is allergic to bee stings, Mr. Flynn temporarily housed the Javits bees in his own bedroom until he could relocate them — something he has done several times before to his own detriment.
There are anywhere from 115,000 to 125,000 beekeepers nationwide, according to the Agricultural Marketing Resource Center. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which oversees city beekeeping, recorded 326 registered hives in 2020. While beekeepers are required to register their hives, they often don’t. Mr. Coté, the president of the New York City Beekeepers Association and a fourth-generation beekeeper, believes there are more than 600 active hives in the city.
Jennifer Walden Weprin, the executive director of the Queens County Farm Museum, has seen renewed interest in the farm’s beekeeping courses, which started up again in the spring. The apiary’s 40 colonies, with over 2 million bees, rival the human population of the borough. The rescue bees will most likely become permanent residents now that they’re settled, but the owners of several of their former homes have expressed interest in creating new rooftop colonies.Many beekeepers know how to spot and manage swarms, which develop when hives are overcrowded and look like “a quivering ball of live bees, usually the size of a basketball,” Mr. Coté said. In a swarm, the queen and a third to a half of the hive leave. They will rest somewhere for up to three days (on a tree, an air-conditioner or a fire hydrant, for example), Mr. Coté said, while “real estate bees” go in search of a suitable new home for the group. Back at the original hive, a new queen is born from eggs that the old queen left behind, the colony repopulates and the cycle continues.
This April, Mr. Coté arrived at his farm in Norwalk, Conn., with a semi-truck full of Italian honeybees from a breeder in Georgia. He then transferred the bees into a cargo van and a pickup truck before heading for the city, carrying 300 separate packages full of 12,000 bees each. He delivered them to enthusiastic fellow beekeepers at a meeting point along Central Park West.
Such bee packages could be problematic, according to Sarah Kornbluth, a field associate with the Division of Invertebrate Zoology at the American Museum of Natural History, who voiced her concern for local birds and other animals that depend on native bees. New York City has about 200 native species (not including honeybees, which originally came from Europe), so honeybees pose stiff competition for the city’s native pollinators, driving them further afield for provisions, which slows their population growth.
“There is no need for European honeybees in the city, and it would be great if we had them only for educational purposes,” said Ms. Kornbluth, who would like to see more of a movement to maintain the bees that are already here. “I think there is a lot of room for fun in native pollinator conservation, and if anyone could do it, it’s the beekeepers.”
There is a small movement afoot: Bee houses are being installed across the city. The Bee Conservancy, based in New York, created its Sponsor-a-Hive program last year in collaboration with Brooklyn Woods, a nonprofit that trains unemployed and low-income adults in woodworking and fabrication. The pine bee houses are designed with a mixture of nesting tubes for native bees to ensure a diversity of species.
“If you want local food, you really need local bees,” said Guillermo Fernandez, the founder and executive director of the Bee Conservancy. “For many bees, an area of a couple hundred feet might be their entire world, so small things can add up to a lot,” said Mr. Fernandez, who finds the chaos of the hive relaxing. “A hive is a box of calm in a frantic city,” he said. “The buzz and gentleness is quite soothing.”
Since February, Brooklyn Woods graduates have created over 350 bee houses. Christine Baerga, 31, who lives in Jamaica, Queens, has had some part in crafting most of them so far. Ms. Baerga’s life changed for the better during the pandemic, when she moved out of a homeless shelter and became a celebrated bee house artisan.
“Bees are master craftsmen and builders,” Ms. Baerga said. “They’re one of the more important creatures in the world. Without them, there is no us.”
Honey bees produce or collect a variety of products that benefit people. These products include honey, beeswax, pollen, royal jelly, and propolis (a sticky resin collected from buds and used as a glue in the hive). Although honey bees can be managed to produce large quantities of these products, they are even more valued for the major role they play in pollination, especially of our agricultural crops. While other insects, birds, and bats also are pollinators, people have little control over the actions or numbers of these pollinators. Honey bee colonies, however, can be easily moved and placed wherever and whenever they are needed for pollination.
Also, honey bees have additional advantages over other pollinators such as their availability in large numbers and their instinctive pollen-hoarding behavior. Without the pollinating service of honey bees, the cost of many fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds would be many times what it is today.
About 150,000 beekeepers manage approximately 2.5 million colonies of honey bees in the United States. Beekeepers derive income from their bees in a variety of ways. Some move their colonies several times during the season to produce a variety of honey crops and/or to pollinate various crops for a fee (apples, peaches, blueberries, or pumpkins, for instance). Some stationary beekeepers have apiaries in good honey-producing locations and make honey crops without moving their bees.
Other beekeepers sell equipment, nucleus colonies, and/ or package bees or rear and sell queens as a source of income. However, the majority of individuals keeping bees today maintain a small number of hives for enjoyment and/or the production of honey for home use and pollination of home gardens and orchards.
Around 175 million pounds of honey are produced annually in the United States. Honey is priced according to its color (water white, extra white, white, extra light amber, light amber, and dark amber), with recent wholesale prices ranging from $1.50 to $2.00 per pound in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. About 3.9 million pounds of beeswax, worth about $7 million, are also produced annually as a by-product of the honey harvest.
The human relationship with honeybees is, he reminds us, unique: unlike domesticated livestock, all honeybees are essentially wild animals that can live very well on their own. Because they seemed to take nicely to the variety of beehives humans have invented over the 10,000-year history of beekeeping, no one thought to reveal the truly secret life of bees. And very few biologists beyond Seeley have the vision and tenacity to conceive of and perform a long-term study of the type that underpins this book.
care and management of colonies of honeybees. They are kept for their honey and other products or their services as pollinators of fruit and vegetable blossoms or as a hobby. The practice is widespread: honeybees are kept in large cities and villages, on farms and rangelands, in forests and deserts, from the Arctic and Antarctic to the Equator. Honeybees are not domesticated. Those living in a man-made domicile called a beehive or hive are no different from those living in a colony in a tree.
In antiquity people knew that bees produce delicious honey, that they sting, and that they increase their numbers by swarming. By the 17th century they had learned the value of smoke in controlling them and had developed the screen veil as protection against stings. From the 17th to the 19th century, the key discoveries upon which modern beekeeping is founded were made. These included the mystery of the queen bee as the mother of nearly all the occupants of the hive, her curious mating technique, parthenogenetic development, the movable frame hives, and the fact that bees rear a new queen if the old one disappears.
Given this knowledge, people were able to divide a colony instead of relying on natural swarming. Then the development of the wax-comb foundation, the starter comb on which bees build straight, easily handled combs, and the discovery that honey can be centrifuged or extracted from them and the combs reused, paved the way for large-scale honey production and modern commercial beekeeping. The identification of bee diseases and their control with drugs, the value of pollen and pollen substitutes in producing strong colonies, and the artificial insemination of queens have increased the honey-production efficiency of colonies.
Honeybees belong to the order Hymenoptera and to one of the Apis species. (For a complete discussion of honeybees, see the article hymenopteran.) Honeybees are social insects noted for providing their nests with large amounts of honey. A colony of honeybees is a highly complex cluster of individuals that functions virtually as a single organism. It usually consists of the queen bee, a fertilized female capable of laying a thousand or more eggs per day; from a few to 60,000 sexually undeveloped females, the worker bees; and from none to 1,000 male bees, or drones. The female of most species of bees is equipped with a venomous sting.
Honeybees collect nectar, a sugary solution, from nectaries in blossoms and sometimes from nectaries on the leaves or stems of plants. Nectar may consist of 50 to 80 percent water, but when the bees convert it into honey it will contain only about 16 to 18 percent water. Sometimes they collect honeydew, an exudate from certain plant-sucking insects, and store it as honey. The primary carbohydrate diet of bees is honey. They also collect pollen, the dustlike male element, from the anthers of flowers. Pollen provides the essential proteins necessary for the rearing of young bees. In the act of collecting nectar and pollen to provision the nest, the bees pollinate the flowers they visit. Honeybees also collect propolis, a resinous material from buds of trees, for sealing cracks in the hive or for covering foreign objects in the hive that they cannot remove. They collect water to air-condition the hive and to dilute the honey when they consume it. A populous colony in a desirable location may, in a year’s time, collect and carry into the hive as much as 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms) of nectar, water, and pollen.Bees secrete beeswax in tiny flakes on the underside of the abdomen and mold it into honeycomb, thin-walled, back-to-back, six-sided cells. The use of the cell varies depending on the needs of the colony. Honey or pollen may be stored in some cells, while the queen lays eggs, normally one per cell, in others. The area where the bees develop from the eggs is called the broodnest. Generally, honey is stored toward the top of the combs and pollen in cells around the broodnest below the honey.
The bees maintain a uniform temperature of about 93 °F (34 °C) in the broodnest regardless of outside temperature. The colony can survive daily maximum temperatures of 120 °F (49 °C) if water is available with which they can air-condition the cluster. When the temperature falls below about 57 °F (14 °C), the bees cease flying, form a tight cluster to conserve heat, and await the return of warm weather. They can survive for several weeks in temperatures of −50 °F (−46 °C).
When summer flowers bloom in profusion, the queen’s egg-laying is stimulated, the cluster expands, and honey accumulates in the combs. When the large number of young bees emerge, the domicile becomes crowded.

When the colony becomes crowded with adult bees and there are insufficient cells in which the queen can lay large numbers of eggs, the worker bees select a dozen or so tiny larvae that would otherwise develop into worker bees. These larvae are fed copiously with royal jelly, a whitish food with the consistency of mayonnaise, produced by certain brood-food glands in the heads of the worker bees. The cell in which the larva is developing is drawn out downward and enlarged to permit development of the queen. Shortly before these virgin queens emerge as adults from their queen cells, the mother queen departs from the beehive with the swarm. Swarming usually occurs during the middle of a warm day, when the queen and a portion of the worker bees (usually from 5,000 to 25,000) suddenly swirl out of the hive and into the air. After a few minutes’ flight, the queen alights, preferably on a branch of a tree but sometimes on a roof, a parked automobile, or even a fire hydrant. All the bees settle into a tight cluster around her while a handful of scouts reconnoitre a new homesite.
When the scout bees have located a new domicile, the cluster breaks. The swarm takes to the air and in a swirling mass proceeds to the new home. Swarming is the bees’ natural method of propagation or increase.

Back in the parent colony, the first queen to emerge after the mother queen departs with the swarm immediately attempts to destroy the others. If two or more emerge at the same time, they fight to the death. When the surviving virgin is about a week old, she soars off on her mating flight. To maintain genetic diversity within a colony, a queen frequently mates with more than one drone (called polyandry) while in the air. She may repeat the mating flights for two or three successive days, after which she begins egg laying. She rarely ever leaves the hive again except with a swarm. Normally, sufficient sperm are stored in her sperm pouch, or spermatheca, to fertilize all the eggs she will lay for the rest of her life. The drones die in the act of mating.
The queen can live up to five years, although many beekeepers replace the queen every year or two. If she is accidentally killed or begins to falter in her egg-laying efficiency, the worker bees will rear a “supersedure” queen that will mate and begin egg laying without a swarm emerging. She ignores the mother queen, who soon disappears from the colony.

Worker bees live about six weeks during the active season but may live for several months if they emerge as adults in the fall and spend the winter in the cluster. As the name implies, worker bees do all the work of the hive, except the egg laying.
Drones are reared only when the colony is populous and there are plentiful sources of nectar and pollen. They usually live a few weeks, but they are driven from the hive to perish when fall or an extended period of adversity comes upon the colony. The only duty of the drone is to mate with the queen.
The queen can lay drone (unfertilized) eggs in the drone cells. If she is not allowed to mate or if her supply of sperm is exhausted, she will lay unfertilized eggs in worker cells. The development of unfertilized eggs into adult drones is known as parthenogenesis. Occasionally a colony may become queenless and unable to develop another queen. Then some of the worker bees begin to lay eggs, often several to a cell, and these develop into drones. A colony that has developed laying workers is difficult to requeen with a laying queen.
The beekeeper’s year starts in early fall. At that time he requeens the colonies whose queens are not producing adequate amounts of brood and makes sure that each colony has sufficient stores: at least 50 pounds (22 kilograms) of honey and several frames filled with pollen. Some beekeepers also feed the drug fumagillin to reduce possible damage to the adult bees by nosema disease (see below Disease and pest control). The colonies need a sunny exposure and protection from cold winds. Some beekeepers in northern and mountainous areas wrap their colonies with insulating material in winter. A few beekeepers kill their bees in the fall, harvest the honey, store the empty equipment, then restock with a two- or three-pound (0.8- or 1.4-kilogram) package of bees and a young queen the following spring.
If the colonies are well prepared in the fall, they need little attention during the winter. But in early spring an examination of the colonies by the beekeeper is important. Frequently, strong colonies exhaust their food supply and starve only a few days before flowers begin to bloom in abundance. Only a few pounds of sugar syrup, 50-50 sugar water, or a honey-filled comb from another more prosperous colony might save such a starving colony. Again fumagillin may be fed to the colony, and some beekeepers also feed a cake of pollen substitute or pollen supplement. Honey is not fed to the colonies unless the beekeeper is sure about its source. Honey from colonies affected by the brood disease American foulbrood could infect his colonies and cause a serious loss.
As the spring season advances, the cluster size increases from the low population of 10,000 to 20,000 bees that survived the winter. To accommodate the increased size of the cluster and broodnest, the keeper adds more supers, or boxes of combs. If the combs are so manipulated that the queen can continually expand her egg-laying area upward, the colony is unlikely to swarm. This can be achieved by placing empty combs or combs in which brood is about ready to emerge at the top of the cluster and combs filled with eggs or young brood toward the lower part of the broodnest. The beekeeper wants the colony to reach its peak of population, 50,000 to 60,000 bees, at the beginning of the major nectar flow.
The bees in a swarm, having departed the hive with a full stomach of honey, rarely sting. The usual way to capture them is to place a hive or upturned box beneath or nearby, then shake or smoke the bees to force the queen and a majority of the bees into it. The others follow. After the swarm is safely inside the box, it can be removed to a permanent location.
Regulations governing the keeping of bees usually require the bees to be kept in hives with movable combs. If the bees are captured in a box, they are generally transferred into a movable-frame hive within a few days so the new honey and comb will not be lost in the transfer.

When a beekeeper requeens a colony, he removes the failing or otherwise undesirable queen and places a new one in a screen cage in the broodnest. After a few days the colony becomes adjusted to her and she can be released from the cage. A strange queen placed in the cluster without this temporary protection usually will be killed at once by the workers. Queens usually are shipped in individual cages of about three cubic inches (50 cubic centimetres) with about half a dozen attendant bees and a ball of specially prepared sugar candy plugging one end of the cage. When the cage is placed in the hive, the bees from both sides eat the candy. By the time the candy is consumed and the bees reach each other, their odours have become indistinguishable, and the queen emerges from the cage into the colony and begins her egg-laying duties.
Standard tools of the beekeeper are: the smoker to quell the bees; a veil to protect the face; gloves for the novice or the person sensitive to stings; a blunt steel blade called a hive tool, for separating the frames and other hive parts for examination; the uncapping knife, for opening the cells of honey; and the extractor, for centrifuging the honey from the cells.

The worker bee sting is barbed, and in the act of stinging it is torn from the bee. It has a venom-filled poison sac and muscles attached that continue to work the sting deeper into the flesh for several minutes and increase the amount of venom injected. To prevent this, the sting should be scraped loose (rather than grasped and pulled out) at once. Bee stings are painful, and no one becomes immune to the pain. Immunity to the swelling is usually built up after a few stings, however.
Normal reaction to a bee sting is immediate, intense pain at the site of the sting. This lasts for a minute or two and is followed by a reddening, which may spread an inch or more. Swelling may not become apparent until the following day. Occasionally, acute allergic reactions develop from a sting, usually with persons who have other allergic problems. Such a reaction becomes evident in less than an hour and may consist of extreme difficulty in breathing, heart irregularity, shock, splotched skin, and speech difficulty. Such persons should obtain the services of a medical doctor immediately.
One of the most mysterious disorders to strike honeybee colonies in the modern era is colony collapse disorder (CCD). It is characterized by sudden colony death, with a lack of healthy adult bees inside the hive. While the underlying cause is not known, it appears that the disorder affects the adult bees’ ability to navigate. They leave the hive to find pollen and never return. Honey and pollen are usually present in the hive, and there is often evidence of recent brood rearing. In some cases the queen and a small number of survivor bees may remain in the brood nest. CCD is also characterized by delayed robbing of the honey in the dead colonies by other, healthy bee colonies in the immediate area, as well as slower than normal invasion by common pests, such as wax moths and small hive beetles. The disorder appears to affect only the European honeybee (Apis mellifera).
CCD was first reported in autumn 2006 by a commercial beekeeper in Pennsylvania, who had colony losses estimated at 80 to 90 percent. Colony losses continued to be reported by other beekeepers in 35 states throughout the United States during the spring and summer of 2007, with many beekeepers losing anywhere from 30 to 90 percent of their hives. Beekeepers in other countries, including Canada, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Greece, Germany, Poland, France, and Switzerland, also reported substantial losses of honeybees. In the following years, the syndrome continued to impact honeybee colonies, though the percentage of colonies lost annually appeared to decline. Nonetheless, the potential economic impact on agriculture is great; annually in the United States alone an estimated $15 billion of crops are pollinated by honeybees.
Studies of adult honeybee carcasses from affected colonies indicate that the bees are infected with a number of pathogens and parasites, including viruses, species of Nosema, and the phorid fly Apocephalus borealis. However, scientists have not reached a definitive conclusion on whether a single pathogen is the root cause of the disorder, and many scientists suspect that a combination of factors are involved, such as a weakened immune system, brought on by colony stress, and the presence of pathogens, which are a constant threat and can be numerous in honeybee colonies. In addition, pesticides such as neonicotinoids (insecticides based on derivatives of nicotine) can be toxic to honeybees and are suspected of causing or contributing to CCD.
Mice frequently enter the hive in winter when the bees are clustered, or they get into stored combs and despoil or damage them by chewing the frames and combs to construct their nest. Skunks devour large numbers of bees at the hive entrance, usually at night. Fences, traps, and poison are used against them. Bears eat the honeybees and the brood in the hive, usually destroying it and its contents in the process. In bear country, electric fences and traps are used to protect bee colonies.
At times bees become their own deadly enemy. If honey is exposed to them when no flowers are in bloom and the weather is mild, the bees from different colonies will fight over it. Sometimes this fighting, or robbing, becomes intense and spreads from hive to hive in moblike action. If all the bees in one colony are killed, the honey is quickly stolen and carried into other hives. This further intensifies the robbing so that a cluster that was carrying honey into its hive a few minutes earlier is attacked, all of its occupants killed, the honey again stolen, and the process repeated. Usually, once robbing becomes intense, only darkness or foul weather will stop it.

The greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, is a lepidopterous insect that, in its larval stage, destroys combs. It does not attack adult bees but may begin destruction of combs of a weak colony long before the bees are gone. It can also destroy stored combs of honey. When the larvae are ready to pupate, they often eat out a place to spin their cocoons in the soft wood of the beehive, damaging frames and other hive parts. The best control for this pest is keeping colonies strong. Stored combs are fumigated, kept in a cold room, or stacked in such a way that a strong air draft flows around them.
The larvae of the lesser wax moth, Achroia grisella, cause damage to stored combs similar to that of the greater wax moth. The Mediterranean flour moth larva, Anagasta kuehniella, feeds on pollen in the combs and causes some damage. Control for both of these moths is the same as for the greater wax moth.
The bee louse, Braula caeca, is a tiny, wingless member of the fly family that is occasionally found on bees. It feeds on nectar or honey from the mouthparts of its host. Its larvae burrow in the cappings of honey combs.
Ants sometimes invade hives and disrupt or kill the bees. Termites can damage or destroy hive parts placed on the soil. Other insects, such as dragonflies (Odonata), robberflies (Diptera), praying mantises (Orthoptera), ambush bugs (Hemiptera), and certain wasps and yellow jackets (Hymenoptera) are natural enemies of the honeybee.

American foulbrood, caused by a spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus larvae, is the most serious brood disease. It occurs throughout the world wherever bees are kept and affects workers, drones, and queens. The spores are highly resistant to heat and chemicals. A comb containing brood severely infected with this disease has a mottled appearance caused by the mixture of healthy capped brood interspersed with diseased or empty cells formerly occupied by diseased brood. The decayed mass has a typical ropiness when dug into, which is one of its identifying characteristics.
American foulbrood can be spread to healthy colonies by transferring equipment or allowing the bees to feed on honey from infected colonies. Sulfathiazole and Terramycin are widely used to control the disease. Many countries and most states in the U.S. require the destruction by fire of diseased colonies and have apiary inspectors to enforce the regulations.
European foulbrood is caused by a nonsporeforming bacterium, Streptococcus pluton, but Bacillus alvie and Acromobacter eurydice are often associated with Streptococcus pluton. This disease is similar in appearance to American foulbrood. In some instances it severely affects the colonies, but they recover so that colony destruction is not necessary. Terramycin can control the disease.
Sacbrood is caused by a virus and is superficially similar to the foulbrood diseases. It can appear and disappear spontaneously but is seldom serious. No chemical control is needed. If the problem persists, the beekeeper usually requeens the colony.
Chalk brood is caused by the fungus Ascosphaera apis. The larvae victims of this disease have a chalky white appearance. Stonebrood, which affects both brood and adults, is also caused by a fungus, Aspergillus flavus, which can usually be isolated from bees that have stonebrood.
Nosema disease, caused by the microsporidian Nosema apis, is the most serious disease of adult bees. It is widespread, causes heavy losses in honey production, and severely weakens colonies. The external symptoms of bees with nosema disease are not apparent. The disease is transmitted from adult to adult by ingestion of the spores that soon germinate in the ventriculus, or main, stomach. An infected ventriculus is normally swollen, soft, and grayish white. A degree of control may be obtained by feeding the colony the drug fumagillin.
Acarine disease is caused by the mite Acarapis woodi that gets into the tracheae of the bee through its breathing holes or spiracles in its thorax or midsection. Bees affected by this mite are unable to fly, have disjointed wings and distended abdomens. There is presently no good control for this mite. The only U.S. federal law pertaining to bees was passed to prevent the importation of adult bees carrying this mite into the United States. Two other mites, Varroa destructor and Tropilaelaps clareae, which are native to Asia, are serious problems for beekeepers. V. destructor is now commonly found in Europe and North America, where it is capable of devastating entire colonies of honeybees.
There are other minor diseases of adult bees, but they seldom cause serious problems.
Backyard beekeeping is increasing in popularity, leading to more people having honey bees as their next-door neighbors. According to the 2017 American Housing Survey, about 52 percent of people in the United States describe their neighborhood as suburban, while only 27 percent describe their neighborhood as urban, and 21 percent as rural. This means that new beekeepers are likely to live in a suburban neighborhood. Additionally, since a typical Langstroth hive only requires a few square feet, almost every backyard has more than enough space for a hive, so just about anyone with a yard could potentially keep bees. 
To successfully keep bees in suburbia does require more than just the physical space for the hives, as keeping bees in close proximity to people has its own set of guidelines that should be followed. First, before you even purchase bees or equipment, you should check to see if there are any community/city/country/state laws where you live that pertain to keeping bees. The laws may say whether or not you can keep bees, dictate how many hives you are allowed to have, and specify how far away the hives can be placed from property lines. The laws are put into place both to protect the beekeeper and also to protect the public. Familiarizing yourself with the laws makes it easier for you to enjoy your hobby and its sweet rewards.

If you’re going to keep bees in your backyard, being a good neighbor is key. A general rule of thumb is that if you’re on good terms with your neighbors before you get bees, then they’ll be just as excited as you are about your new hobby. But, if you’re on bad terms with your neighbor(s), then getting bees is like pouring gasoline on an open fire. The best thing to do is ask yourself, “What do my neighbors think of me?” If you’re honest with yourself and your answer is not positive, then write down a list of things that you can do to be a better neighbor, otherwise it may be a constant struggle for you and your bees. 
Establish an open line of communication with your neighbors. Give them your phone number and encourage them to call anytime they have any questions, or if any issues arise, such as concerns about stings or if a swarm of bees bivouacs in their yard. Rather than letting them panic, it’s better if they call so that you can be a good bee neighbor and take care of the situation before it gets out of hand. Whenever you’re speaking with your neighbors, always ask about any concerns they might have and address each one to the best of your ability. If you don’t know the answer to any of their questions, you can always get back to them after you’ve found the answer by asking more experienced beekeepers in your area, or by searching trusted sources such as the Cornell Pollinator Network Resources page. Last, remember that it’s always a good idea to utilize the beekeeper’s irresistible “superpower,” by giving jars of honey to each of your neighbors. Once they taste pure, local honey, they may likely become one of your biggest fans and be sweet on having bees—and free honey—close by. 

Educating people about bees is important, as the non-beekeeping public often thinks that honey bees, yellowjackets, wasps, and hornets are all flying, sting-machines that love to make pincushions out of every human they see. Too often when someone finds out that you keep bees, they’re thinking about the old Bugs Bunny cartoons where all the bees come out of the hive and form a giant mallet to clobber people into the ground. Therefore, it’s a good idea to educate your neighbors about honey bee behavior and explain why they don’t have to worry. Key points that you can mention include the following:
1.	Having bees next door will not increase the number of bees in their yard
	Honey bees travel great distances to collect food. They routinely visit flowers up to 3 miles from their hive. Bees also tend to cruise at altitudes of 30 feet and higher, well above the space that people occupy.
	One yard does not have nearly enough flowers to support a honey bee colony. Around two million flowers are needed to make a single pound of honey, and colonies can make upwards of 100 pounds when conditions are good.
	Flowers have a finite amount of nectar and pollen, so regardless of where a hive is located, bees will only visit someone’s yard when the flowers are inviting them with nectar and pollen.
	Bees get all of their food from plants. They are not scavengers or hunters like other insects. Yellowjackets, on the other hand, are attracted to sugary sodas and some picnic foods.
 
2.	Honey bees are typically gentle insects.
	Honey bees only sting when provoked, and most stocks that suburban beekeepers keep have been bred for gentleness. 
	Honey bees die when they sting, so they only use their stinger when needed. This can happen if they are swatted, stepped on, or if their hive is disturbed. 
Since a lot of people call any striped insect that flies a “bee,” it is a good idea to teach people the differences between honey bees and wasps, especially since most people get stung by yellowjackets. The more people know about honey bees, the less likely you and your bees will get blamed any time someone gets stung. Explain that the honey bee’s stinger is barbed like a fishhook, causing bees to die when they sting. A yellowjacket’s stinger, on the other hand, is smooth like a doctor’s syringe, allowing yellowjackets to sting repeatedly and often. It’s also good to point out that honey bees never live in a hole in the ground, or in any paper-looking nest, especially a ball-shaped one hanging from a tree. Another easy way to get people to remember the difference between the two is pointing out that honey bees are fuzzy (covered in hair) and brown, while yellowjackets are practically hairless, look smooth and shiny, and are yellow and black in color. 
Additionally, talk with people about all the trees, flowers, fruits, nuts, and vegetables that depend on honey bees for pollination. Explaining to people that having bees around will help their yards to look better and their vegetable gardens grow is the fastest way to get people to welcome your bees to the neighborhood. 

Once you’re on good terms with your neighbors, the next important aspect to backyard beekeeping is to assess your yard as an apiary. The general suggestions of where to place your hives, such as facing hives south and on dry, flat ground, still apply. But if you have neighbors close by, there are additional best practices you must also follow. First, it’s a good idea to think about how non-beekeepers will be using your yard. While a south-facing hive is best, you also have to think about what will be happening 10-15 feet in front of your hives. One way to visualize the bees’ flight path is to stand where you’re thinking of putting your hives and spraying a hose 10 feet, 15 feet, even 20 feet in front of you. What are the chances of someone, or something, getting wet? What kind of foot traffic does that area of the yard get? It is equally as important to think about how your neighbors use their yard, so it is not a good idea to put a hive directly on a property line. Instead, place your hives ten feet or more from the property line. Make sure there is a fence around your hives or yard to keep any inquisitive neighbors from accidently getting too close to your hives or walking into the bees’ flight path. Another way to keep bees and people out of one another’s way is to use a flight barrier: tall bushes, the side of your garage or shed, or anything else that forces the bees to immediately fly up into the air and away from people.
It’s also important to provide your bees with water on your property so they don’t make a neighbor’s pool, dog bowl, air conditioner, birdbath, koi pond, or other water source their own. Keep a water source within fifteen feet of your hive(s) year-round, so that they orient on the source you have provided for them before any scout bees find water sources in a neighbor’s yard.
If you are just starting out, most reputable beekeeping sources will recommend starting with two hives. Having two hives for your first few years will help you to learn the art and science of beekeeping, while providing you with the proper amount of experience and resources needed to successfully keep healthy bees. However, after a few years, many beekeepers want to expand and keep more than two hives. In suburbia, your lot size will dictate how many hives you can realistically and safely keep on your property. Generally, the best practice to follow is no more than three colonies on any lot of one-quarter acre or less (not counting nucs). Then, for every additional one-quarter of an acre, add another three hives. So one-half acre could have up to six hives, three-quarters acre could have up to nine hives, and a one acre lot could have up to twelve hives. Additionally, keeping one nuc for every two hives is also acceptable. Regardless of the size of your property, it is much more important to always expand slowly, over time, by adding one or two hives per year. Expanding too quickly in a populated neighborhood could lead to severe, unwanted bee-people interactions, which is one reason why expanding slower is better. Also, if and when you are ready to expand, rather than overloading your backyard with too many hives, another option could be to find other yards close by to keep some of your hives. You may find people in your community that don’t want to care for bees, but for just a share of the honey, would welcome having your hives on their property.

Issues can arise when bees’ robbing instincts are engaged. Robbing is a detrimental behavior because it can spread parasites and diseases among colonies, can significantly weaken or kill small colonies, and can be an alarming sight to behold for passersby. If all the nectar sources have dried up and a colony is low on food, it is essential that suburban beekeepers take precautions for robbing behavior. In northeastern states like New York, robbing tends to happen most often during dearth periods in mid July, late September, and October. There are many things a suburban beekeeper can do to prevent and manage robbing. First, they could feed sugar syrup only in feeders that are inside a hive. Boardman (entrance) feeders and open containers of syrup can trigger a robbing response, attracting bees to the area and creating a frenzy. Second, they should be careful not to spill any sugar syrup or drip unripened nectar outside of the hive during a dearth. If they do, they should clean it up immediately. Third, they can install entrance reducers or robbing screens on smaller or weaker colonies to help prevent robbers from entering. Forth, honey supers should be removed before the nectar dearth, remain covered until brought inside for extraction, and never left unattended in the apiary. Last, all honey extraction should take place inside, in a bee-tight room. After extraction, wet honey supers should be placed temporarily back on the hives beneath the outer cover for the bees to clean. It is recommended to avoid placing uncovered, wet supers out in the open, as this encourages robbing activity.
There are potentially other scenarios that could possibly arise that would also require you to respond. Your primary responsibility as a suburban beekeeper will be to always act quickly and resolve any issue before it becomes a major concern. The best thing you can do to ensure that you’re being a good beekeeper is to join your local beekeeping club. A club will connect you with experienced beekeepers that can help you become a better beekeeper and offer advice on keeping bees in your community. By joining a club, you will also be able to find a beekeeping friend who could help you when you need it, and perhaps look after your colonies while you’re out of town. Regardless of how much you know, there is always so much to learn about bees and beekeeping, which is why having a network of other beekeepers in your area is so important. Beekeeping clubs can keep you up-to-date on the latest research, the best USDA-approved mite treatments to use in your area, and provide you with a community that is always willing to talk about bees. Backyard beekeeping is an enjoyable and rewarding pastime. It’s something the whole family can do together, or something you can do by yourself for a few moments of solitude. Having bees in your backyard means that you can grab a cup of coffee and head outside to hang with your colonies and watch your bees busy at work. There are a few extra requirements for keeping bees in suburbia, but the underlying theme and golden rule of suburban beekeeping is to respect your neighbors, your bees, and your environment.
beekeeping, care and management of colonies of honeybees. They are kept for their honey and other products or their services as pollinators of fruit and vegetable blossoms or as a hobby. The practice is widespread: honeybees are kept in large cities and villages, on farms and rangelands, in forests and deserts, from the Arctic and Antarctic to the Equator. Honeybees are not domesticated. Those living in a man-made domicile called a beehive or hive are no different from those living in a colony in a tree.
In antiquity people knew that bees produce delicious honey, that they sting, and that they increase their numbers by swarming. By the 17th century they had learned the value of smoke in controlling them and had developed the screen veil as protection against stings. From the 17th to the 19th century, the key discoveries upon which modern beekeeping is founded were made. These included the mystery of the queen bee as the mother of nearly all the occupants of the hive, her curious mating technique, parthenogenetic development, the movable frame hives, and the fact that bees rear a new queen if the old one disappears.
Given this knowledge, people were able to divide a colony instead of relying on natural swarming. Then the development of the wax-comb foundation, the starter comb on which bees build straight, easily handled combs, and the discovery that honey can be centrifuged or extracted from them and the combs reused, paved the way for large-scale honey production and modern commercial beekeeping. The identification of bee diseases and their control with drugs, the value of pollen and pollen substitutes in producing strong colonies, and the artificial insemination of queens have increased the honey-production efficiency of colonies.
Honeybees belong to the order Hymenoptera and to one of the Apis species. (For a complete discussion of honeybees, see the article hymenopteran.) Honeybees are social insects noted for providing their nests with large amounts of honey. A colony of honeybees is a highly complex cluster of individuals that functions virtually as a single organism. It usually consists of the queen bee, a fertilized female capable of laying a thousand or more eggs per day; from a few to 60,000 sexually undeveloped females, the worker bees; and from none to 1,000 male bees, or drones. The female of most species of bees is equipped with a venomous sting.

Honeybees collect nectar, a sugary solution, from nectaries in blossoms and sometimes from nectaries on the leaves or stems of plants. Nectar may consist of 50 to 80 percent water, but when the bees convert it into honey it will contain only about 16 to 18 percent water. Sometimes they collect honeydew, an exudate from certain plant-sucking insects, and store it as honey. The primary carbohydrate diet of bees is honey. They also collect pollen, the dustlike male element, from the anthers of flowers. Pollen provides the essential proteins necessary for the rearing of young bees. In the act of collecting nectar and pollen to provision the nest, the bees pollinate the flowers they visit. Honeybees also collect propolis, a resinous material from buds of trees, for sealing cracks in the hive or for covering foreign objects in the hive that they cannot remove. They collect water to air-condition the hive and to dilute the honey when they consume it. A populous colony in a desirable location may, in a year’s time, collect and carry into the hive as much as 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms) of nectar, water, and pollen.

Bees secrete beeswax in tiny flakes on the underside of the abdomen and mold it into honeycomb, thin-walled, back-to-back, six-sided cells. The use of the cell varies depending on the needs of the colony. Honey or pollen may be stored in some cells, while the queen lays eggs, normally one per cell, in others. The area where the bees develop from the eggs is called the broodnest. Generally, honey is stored toward the top of the combs and pollen in cells around the broodnest below the honey.
The bees maintain a uniform temperature of about 93 °F (34 °C) in the broodnest regardless of outside temperature. The colony can survive daily maximum temperatures of 120 °F (49 °C) if water is available with which they can air-condition the cluster. When the temperature falls below about 57 °F (14 °C), the bees cease flying, form a tight cluster to conserve heat, and await the return of warm weather. They can survive for several weeks in temperatures of −50 °F (−46 °C).
When summer flowers bloom in profusion, the queen’s egg-laying is stimulated, the cluster expands, and honey accumulates in the combs. When the large number of young bees emerge, the domicile becomes crowded.

When the colony becomes crowded with adult bees and there are insufficient cells in which the queen can lay large numbers of eggs, the worker bees select a dozen or so tiny larvae that would otherwise develop into worker bees. These larvae are fed copiously with royal jelly, a whitish food with the consistency of mayonnaise, produced by certain brood-food glands in the heads of the worker bees. The cell in which the larva is developing is drawn out downward and enlarged to permit development of the queen. Shortly before these virgin queens emerge as adults from their queen cells, the mother queen departs from the beehive with the swarm. Swarming usually occurs during the middle of a warm day, when the queen and a portion of the worker bees (usually from 5,000 to 25,000) suddenly swirl out of the hive and into the air. After a few minutes’ flight, the queen alights, preferably on a branch of a tree but sometimes on a roof, a parked automobile, or even a fire hydrant. All the bees settle into a tight cluster around her while a handful of scouts reconnoitre a new homesite.
When the scout bees have located a new domicile, the cluster breaks. The swarm takes to the air and in a swirling mass proceeds to the new home. Swarming is the bees’ natural method of propagation or increase.

Back in the parent colony, the first queen to emerge after the mother queen departs with the swarm immediately attempts to destroy the others. If two or more emerge at the same time, they fight to the death. When the surviving virgin is about a week old, she soars off on her mating flight. To maintain genetic diversity within a colony, a queen frequently mates with more than one drone (called polyandry) while in the air. She may repeat the mating flights for two or three successive days, after which she begins egg laying. She rarely ever leaves the hive again except with a swarm. Normally, sufficient sperm are stored in her sperm pouch, or spermatheca, to fertilize all the eggs she will lay for the rest of her life. The drones die in the act of mating.
The queen can live up to five years, although many beekeepers replace the queen every year or two. If she is accidentally killed or begins to falter in her egg-laying efficiency, the worker bees will rear a “supersedure” queen that will mate and begin egg laying without a swarm emerging. She ignores the mother queen, who soon disappears from the colony.

Worker bees live about six weeks during the active season but may live for several months if they emerge as adults in the fall and spend the winter in the cluster. As the name implies, worker bees do all the work of the hive, except the egg laying.

Drones are reared only when the colony is populous and there are plentiful sources of nectar and pollen. They usually live a few weeks, but they are driven from the hive to perish when fall or an extended period of adversity comes upon the colony. The only duty of the drone is to mate with the queen.
The queen can lay drone (unfertilized) eggs in the drone cells. If she is not allowed to mate or if her supply of sperm is exhausted, she will lay unfertilized eggs in worker cells. The development of unfertilized eggs into adult drones is known as parthenogenesis. Occasionally a colony may become queenless and unable to develop another queen. Then some of the worker bees begin to lay eggs, often several to a cell, and these develop into drones. A colony that has developed laying workers is difficult to requeen with a laying queen.
The beekeeper’s year starts in early fall. At that time he requeens the colonies whose queens are not producing adequate amounts of brood and makes sure that each colony has sufficient stores: at least 50 pounds (22 kilograms) of honey and several frames filled with pollen. Some beekeepers also feed the drug fumagillin to reduce possible damage to the adult bees by nosema disease (see below Disease and pest control). The colonies need a sunny exposure and protection from cold winds. Some beekeepers in northern and mountainous areas wrap their colonies with insulating material in winter. A few beekeepers kill their bees in the fall, harvest the honey, store the empty equipment, then restock with a two- or three-pound (0.8- or 1.4-kilogram) package of bees and a young queen the following spring.
If the colonies are well prepared in the fall, they need little attention during the winter. But in early spring an examination of the colonies by the beekeeper is important. Frequently, strong colonies exhaust their food supply and starve only a few days before flowers begin to bloom in abundance. Only a few pounds of sugar syrup, 50-50 sugar water, or a honey-filled comb from another more prosperous colony might save such a starving colony. Again fumagillin may be fed to the colony, and some beekeepers also feed a cake of pollen substitute or pollen supplement. Honey is not fed to the colonies unless the beekeeper is sure about its source. Honey from colonies affected by the brood disease American foulbrood could infect his colonies and cause a serious loss.
As the spring season advances, the cluster size increases from the low population of 10,000 to 20,000 bees that survived the winter. To accommodate the increased size of the cluster and broodnest, the keeper adds more supers, or boxes of combs. If the combs are so manipulated that the queen can continually expand her egg-laying area upward, the colony is unlikely to swarm. This can be achieved by placing empty combs or combs in which brood is about ready to emerge at the top of the cluster and combs filled with eggs or young brood toward the lower part of the broodnest. The beekeeper wants the colony to reach its peak of population, 50,000 to 60,000 bees, at the beginning of the major nectar flow.
The bees in a swarm, having departed the hive with a full stomach of honey, rarely sting. The usual way to capture them is to place a hive or upturned box beneath or nearby, then shake or smoke the bees to force the queen and a majority of the bees into it. The others follow. After the swarm is safely inside the box, it can be removed to a permanent location.
Regulations governing the keeping of bees usually require the bees to be kept in hives with movable combs. If the bees are captured in a box, they are generally transferred into a movable-frame hive within a few days so the new honey and comb will not be lost in the transfer.

When a beekeeper requeens a colony, he removes the failing or otherwise undesirable queen and places a new one in a screen cage in the broodnest. After a few days the colony becomes adjusted to her and she can be released from the cage. A strange queen placed in the cluster without this temporary protection usually will be killed at once by the workers. Queens usually are shipped in individual cages of about three cubic inches (50 cubic centimetres) with about half a dozen attendant bees and a ball of specially prepared sugar candy plugging one end of the cage. When the cage is placed in the hive, the bees from both sides eat the candy. By the time the candy is consumed and the bees reach each other, their odours have become indistinguishable, and the queen emerges from the cage into the colony and begins her egg-laying duties.
Beekeeping equipment
Standard tools of the beekeeper are: the smoker to quell the bees; a veil to protect the face; gloves for the novice or the person sensitive to stings; a blunt steel blade called a hive tool, for separating the frames and other hive parts for examination; the uncapping knife, for opening the cells of honey; and the extractor, for centrifuging the honey from the cells.

The worker bee sting is barbed, and in the act of stinging it is torn from the bee. It has a venom-filled poison sac and muscles attached that continue to work the sting deeper into the flesh for several minutes and increase the amount of venom injected. To prevent this, the sting should be scraped loose (rather than grasped and pulled out) at once. Bee stings are painful, and no one becomes immune to the pain. Immunity to the swelling is usually built up after a few stings, however.
Normal reaction to a bee sting is immediate, intense pain at the site of the sting. This lasts for a minute or two and is followed by a reddening, which may spread an inch or more. Swelling may not become apparent until the following day. Occasionally, acute allergic reactions develop from a sting, usually with persons who have other allergic problems. Such a reaction becomes evident in less than an hour and may consist of extreme difficulty in breathing, heart irregularity, shock, splotched skin, and speech difficulty. Such persons should obtain the services of a medical doctor immediately.
Honey is marketed in several different forms: liquid honey, comb honey, and creamed honey. Sometimes the predominant floral type from which the honey was collected is indicated.
Liquid honey
If liquid (strained, extracted) honey is desired, additional supers are added directly above the brood nest. When one is largely filled, it is raised and another is placed underneath. This may continue until several have been filled, each holding from 30 to 50 pounds (14 to 23 kilograms), or until the nectar flow has ended. After the bees have evaporated the water until the honey is of the desired consistency and sealed in the cells, the combs are removed, the cells uncapped with the uncapping knife, and the honey extracted. The removed honey is immediately heated to about 140 °F (60 °C), which thins it and destroys yeasts that can cause fermentation. It is then strained of wax particles and pollen grains, cooled rapidly, and packaged for market.
In production of honey in the comb, or comb honey, extreme care is necessary to prevent the bees’ swarming. The colony must be strong, and the bees must be crowded into the smallest space they will tolerate without swarming. New frames or sections of a frame with extra-thin foundation wax, added at exactly the right time for the bees to fill without destroying them, are placed directly above the brood nest. The bees must fill and seal the new comb to permit removal within a few days, or it will be of inferior quality. As rapidly as sections are removed, new sections are added, until the nectar flow subsides. Then these are removed and the colony given combs to store its honey for the winter.
Creamed honey
Almost all honey will granulate or turn to sugar. Such honey can be liquefied without materially affecting its quality by placing the container in water heated to about 150 °F (66 °C). Liquid and granulated honey is sometimes blended, homogenized, and held at a cool temperature, which speeds uniformly fine granulation. If properly processed, the granules will be extremely fine; the honey, which has a smooth, creamy appearance, is referred to as creamed honey.

Some honeys are sold by floral type; that is, they are given the name of the predominant flowers visited by the bees when they accumulated the honey. The beekeeper has no way to direct the bees to a particular source of food but through experience learns which plants are the major sources of honey. Different flowers produce different colours and flavours of honey. It may be heavy-bodied or thin-bodied, dark or light, mild-flavoured or strong-flavoured. Most honey has been blended by the beekeeper to a standard grade that can be supplied and marketed year after year.

Beeswax is a by-product of beekeeping in most areas. When beekeepers uncap or break honeycombs or have unusable combs, they try to salvage the beeswax. First, they recover as much honey from the combs as possible by drainage or extraction. Then they place the material in water heated to slightly over 145 °F (63 °C). This melts the wax, which rises to the surface. After it cools and hardens, the cake of wax is removed and refined for reuse in comb foundation. Beeswax has many other uses: in quality candles, cosmetics, agriculture, art, and industry. In some areas bees are manipulated primarily for wax production. Wax is a highly stable commodity that can be transported long distances under unfavourable conditions without damage.Queens are reared for sale to other beekeepers for requeening established colonies or for adding to a 2- or 3-pound (0.9- or 1.4-kilogram) package of 8,000 to 10,000 live bees to form new colonies or replenish weak ones. The queens are produced when the beekeeper cages the reigning queen in a colony, then inserts into the cluster from 30 to 60 queen cell bases into which young (one-day-old) worker larvae have been transferred. Queens can be artificially inseminated with sperm from drones of a known source, but most beekeepers let the queens mate naturally. The live bees are shaken from the combs of the colony through a funnel into screen-wire cages.
The greatest value of bees is in their service as pollinators. Some 90 crops grown in the United States alone are dependent on insect pollination, performed primarily by the honeybee. The average colony of bees is worth from 20 to 40 times as much in the pollination of crops as it is in the production of honey. The value of bees in the pollination of ornamental plants has never been calculated. Bees are also valuable in the pollination of some forest and range plants that produce seeds on which birds and other wildlife feed.
When bees are used in the pollination of crops, the beekeeper places the colonies within or adjacent to the field to be pollinated. The majority of the roughly 1,000,000 colonies that are used for pollination are used in alfalfa-seed fields and almond and apple orchards. The colonies are distributed at the rate of two or more per acre in groups every 0.1 mile (0.16 kilometre) throughout alfalfa fields. Two colonies per acre are recommended for almond orchards and about one colony per acre in apple orchards.
Some growers prefer to have the colonies placed alongside the orchard; others want them distributed in small groups within the orchard. Bees also are used regularly by growers of many other crops: blueberries, cantaloupes, cherries, clovers, cucumbers, cranberries, cutflower seed, plums and prunes, vetch, and watermelon.

Honeybees have diseases and enemies: diseases of the brood; diseases that affect only the adult bees; insect enemies of the adults and of the comb; and other enemies, including toads, lizards, birds, mice, skunks, and bears.
American foulbrood, caused by a spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus larvae, is the most serious brood disease. It occurs throughout the world wherever bees are kept and affects workers, drones, and queens. The spores are highly resistant to heat and chemicals. A comb containing brood severely infected with this disease has a mottled appearance caused by the mixture of healthy capped brood interspersed with diseased or empty cells formerly occupied by diseased brood. The decayed mass has a typical ropiness when dug into, which is one of its identifying characteristics.
American foulbrood can be spread to healthy colonies by transferring equipment or allowing the bees to feed on honey from infected colonies. Sulfathiazole and Terramycin are widely used to control the disease. Many countries and most states in the U.S. require the destruction by fire of diseased colonies and have apiary inspectors to enforce the regulations.

European foulbrood is caused by a nonsporeforming bacterium, Streptococcus pluton, but Bacillus alvie and Acromobacter eurydice are often associated with Streptococcus pluton. This disease is similar in appearance to American foulbrood. In some instances it severely affects the colonies, but they recover so that colony destruction is not necessary. Terramycin can control the disease.

Sacbrood is caused by a virus and is superficially similar to the foulbrood diseases. It can appear and disappear spontaneously but is seldom serious. No chemical control is needed. If the problem persists, the beekeeper usually requeens the colony.

Chalk brood is caused by the fungus Ascosphaera apis. The larvae victims of this disease have a chalky white appearance. Stonebrood, which affects both brood and adults, is also caused by a fungus, Aspergillus flavus, which can usually be isolated from bees that have stonebrood.

Nosema disease, caused by the microsporidian Nosema apis, is the most serious disease of adult bees. It is widespread, causes heavy losses in honey production, and severely weakens colonies. The external symptoms of bees with nosema disease are not apparent. The disease is transmitted from adult to adult by ingestion of the spores that soon germinate in the ventriculus, or main, stomach. An infected ventriculus is normally swollen, soft, and grayish white. A degree of control may be obtained by feeding the colony the drug fumagillin.

Acarine disease is caused by the mite Acarapis woodi that gets into the tracheae of the bee through its breathing holes or spiracles in its thorax or midsection. Bees affected by this mite are unable to fly, have disjointed wings and distended abdomens. There is presently no good control for this mite. The only U.S. federal law pertaining to bees was passed to prevent the importation of adult bees carrying this mite into the United States. Two other mites, Varroa destructor and Tropilaelaps clareae, which are native to Asia, are serious problems for beekeepers. V. destructor is now commonly found in Europe and North America, where it is capable of devastating entire colonies of honeybees.
There are other minor diseases of adult bees, but they seldom cause serious problems.

The greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, is a lepidopterous insect that, in its larval stage, destroys combs. It does not attack adult bees but may begin destruction of combs of a weak colony long before the bees are gone. It can also destroy stored combs of honey. When the larvae are ready to pupate, they often eat out a place to spin their cocoons in the soft wood of the beehive, damaging frames and other hive parts. The best control for this pest is keeping colonies strong. Stored combs are fumigated, kept in a cold room, or stacked in such a way that a strong air draft flows around them.
The larvae of the lesser wax moth, Achroia grisella, cause damage to stored combs similar to that of the greater wax moth. The Mediterranean flour moth larva, Anagasta kuehniella, feeds on pollen in the combs and causes some damage. Control for both of these moths is the same as for the greater wax moth.

The bee louse, Braula caeca, is a tiny, wingless member of the fly family that is occasionally found on bees. It feeds on nectar or honey from the mouthparts of its host. Its larvae burrow in the cappings of honey combs.

Ants sometimes invade hives and disrupt or kill the bees. Termites can damage or destroy hive parts placed on the soil. Other insects, such as dragonflies (Odonata), robberflies (Diptera), praying mantises (Orthoptera), ambush bugs (Hemiptera), and certain wasps and yellow jackets (Hymenoptera) are natural enemies of the honeybee.

Mice frequently enter the hive in winter when the bees are clustered, or they get into stored combs and despoil or damage them by chewing the frames and combs to construct their nest. Skunks devour large numbers of bees at the hive entrance, usually at night. Fences, traps, and poison are used against them. Bears eat the honeybees and the brood in the hive, usually destroying it and its contents in the process. In bear country, electric fences and traps are used to protect bee colonies.

At times bees become their own deadly enemy. If honey is exposed to them when no flowers are in bloom and the weather is mild, the bees from different colonies will fight over it. Sometimes this fighting, or robbing, becomes intense and spreads from hive to hive in moblike action. If all the bees in one colony are killed, the honey is quickly stolen and carried into other hives. This further intensifies the robbing so that a cluster that was carrying honey into its hive a few minutes earlier is attacked, all of its occupants killed, the honey again stolen, and the process repeated. Usually, once robbing becomes intense, only darkness or foul weather will stop it.

One of the most mysterious disorders to strike honeybee colonies in the modern era is colony collapse disorder (CCD). It is characterized by sudden colony death, with a lack of healthy adult bees inside the hive. While the underlying cause is not known, it appears that the disorder affects the adult bees’ ability to navigate. They leave the hive to find pollen and never return. Honey and pollen are usually present in the hive, and there is often evidence of recent brood rearing. In some cases the queen and a small number of survivor bees may remain in the brood nest. CCD is also characterized by delayed robbing of the honey in the dead colonies by other, healthy bee colonies in the immediate area, as well as slower than normal invasion by common pests, such as wax moths and small hive beetles. The disorder appears to affect only the European honeybee (Apis mellifera).

CCD was first reported in autumn 2006 by a commercial beekeeper in Pennsylvania, who had colony losses estimated at 80 to 90 percent. Colony losses continued to be reported by other beekeepers in 35 states throughout the United States during the spring and summer of 2007, with many beekeepers losing anywhere from 30 to 90 percent of their hives. Beekeepers in other countries, including Canada, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Greece, Germany, Poland, France, and Switzerland, also reported substantial losses of honeybees. In the following years, the syndrome continued to impact honeybee colonies, though the percentage of colonies lost annually appeared to decline. Nonetheless, the potential economic impact on agriculture is great; annually in the United States alone an estimated $15 billion of crops are pollinated by honeybees.

Studies of adult honeybee carcasses from affected colonies indicate that the bees are infected with a number of pathogens and parasites, including viruses, species of Nosema, and the phorid fly Apocephalus borealis. However, scientists have not reached a definitive conclusion on whether a single pathogen is the root cause of the disorder, and many scientists suspect that a combination of factors are involved, such as a weakened immune system, brought on by colony stress, and the presence of pathogens, which are a constant threat and can be numerous in honeybee colonies. In addition, pesticides such as neonicotinoids (insecticides based on derivatives of nicotine) can be toxic to honeybees and are suspected of causing or contributing to CCD.

Bees and beekeeping have been subjects of vital importance in the world's agricultural literature for centuries. Special Collections holds many resources that trace the history of beekeeping from the earliest published works on honeybee husbandry, such as the 1572 edition of Thomas Hill's A pleasant instruction of the parfit ordering of Bees. Other works mark the advancement of scientific knowledge about bees. An example of this is Charles Butler's The Feminine Monarchie: or The Historie of Bees (originally published in 1609). Butler was among the earliest observers to recognize that worker bees were female instead of male, as was commonly believed when he first published his book in 1609 (Special Collections has the 1623 and 1634 editions).

Among Special Collections' historical resources on bee culture are numerous illustrated works showing the wide variety of hives and equipment that were used in the United States and around the world. In addition to rare books, nursery and seed trade catalogs advertising beekeepers' supplies provide glimpses into the art and craft of beekeeping.

way to insure the colony you have is healthy and of
a particular race or hybrid. A package should be
installed in the early spring to take advantage of the
nectar flow.
A package consists of a known amount (by
weight) of bees and a caged queen shipped in a screen
box containing a feeder can of sugar syrup. Packages
can be bought in 2-, 3- and 5-pound sizes. One pound
contains about 4000 bees. They should be ordered
long before you want to receive them, ideally in the
Fall.
Inspect the package. If the majority of the workers
are dead or the queen is dead, contact your supplier
for instructions and possible replacement. If all is well,
place the bees in a cool, dark place until early evening.

Installing apackage of bees into a single deep hive body. the feeder can is resting of the corner of the hive.
Installation
The cage should be installed into one single
deep or two medium hive bodies. You can use all
new foundation, drawn comb or a mixture. If using a
mixture, put the drawn comb in the center to facilitate
egg-laying there. Make sure the drawn comb was
taken from healthy colonies.
In the early evening, take the package to the
apiary. Spray more sugar solution onto the sides of the
package. Remove the outer and inner covers from the
hive. Remove four or five frames from one end of the
hive body or both bodies (medium body). Spray sugar
solution lightly onto the remaining frames and on the
inner walls of the hive body.
Remove the top cover and feeder can from the
package. Remove the queen cage from the package
and cover the opening of the package. Remove the
cork from the end of the queen cage plugged with
candy and use a nail to poke a hole in the candy,
being careful not to harm the queen. Suspend the
cage, candy end up, between the two center frames
of those remaining in the hive body. For medium
hive bodies, suspend the cage within the bottom hive
body. Remove the cover from the hole in the top of the
package, shake about a cupful of bees onto the queen
cage then place the package, with the hole end up, in
the open space within the hive.
Replace the inner cover and place a feeder can
with a 2:1 sugar solution and Fumidil-BTM(according
to label directions) over the opening in the inner cover.
(Be sure the queen cage is not directly below the inner
cover opening.) Place an empty super on the inner
cover around the feeder can and cover this with the
outer cover. Partially block the hive entrance with
a entrance reducer or grass and leave it blocked for
about a month.
Check the queen cage in three days to see if the
queen has been released. If she has not been released,
remove the screen and let her walk into the colony.
Then, do not disturb the colony for 10 days. At this
time, examine the frames for a brood pattern. If a
brood pattern and eggs are found, then you have
successfully installed the package. Remove the
package container and replace the frames removed
earlier. Close the colony.

Other Methods of Bee Installation
There are variations of the installation method
mentioned above, including differences in releasing
the queen and the workers. After suspending the
queen cage, gently shake the bees from the package
onto the bottom board. Lightly mist the bees with
sugar solution. Replace the frames, being careful not to crush any bees. Close the hive and proceed as
above.
Another method of queen introduction is to place
the queen cage on the bottom board, shake a cupful
of bees onto the cage, then shake the remaining bees
onto the bottom board.
Also, the queen may be released more
immediately by removing the cork-only plug end of
queen cage. But likelihood of queen acceptance is
reduced using this method of release.

Before entering the apiary, suit up in appropriate attire. If not wearing a bee suit (Beekeeping Protective Gear), dress in light-colored, cotton or rip-stop nylon clothing. Always wear a veil. Wrap the bottoms of your pants’ legs around the top of your boots and secure them in place with a rubber band or tape. Bees drop from handled frames to the ground and may crawl up your legs as you work around the hive. Gloves are optional. Beginners should wear gloves until they feel confident without them.
Light your smoker and fill the chamber with fuel.
Approach the colony from the rear or the side. Always work the colony from the rear or the side. Apply two gentle puffs of smoke into the entrance. Pry the outer cover up 2 to 3 inches along one side. Lightly puff under the outer space and replace it. Wait about 30 seconds before removing the outer and inner covers.

Gently remove the outer cover and place it on the ground, upside down, near the colony. It can be used as a base for stacking supers or brood chambers that you remove as you inspect the colony. Gently remove the inner cover and lean it near the entrance so that clinging bees can reenter the hive. Do not block the
entrance with the inner cover.

When removing and handling frames, work with slow, steady movements. Avoid bumping or shaking motions that may shake bees off the frame. Lightly smoke bees to manipulate their movement, such as when you need to examine frames for eggs. Before replacing a frame, smoke the bees out of the way to avoid crushing them.

Do not leave colonies open for too long. Bees may get overly defensive and an open hive may initiate robbing behavior. Before closing the hive, use smoke to move bees back onto the frames from the edge and outside walls of hive bodies.

Open a colony when the temperature is 55 degrees F or warmer, the sun is shining, the bees are flying and the wind is calm. Open and inspect colonies once a week during spring build-up and honey production. Colonies should be opened and inspected one or more times each month from February through November.

Items you should bring to the apiary or that you should keep on hand:

• Extra hive tool or tools, gloves, veil, bee suit and
smoker.

• Matches or lighter.

• Dry smoker fuel.

• Extra frames with drawn comb or new foundation,
and extra hive bodies.

• Container to collect wax scrapings or propolis.

• Jars or sealable bags to collect bees for mite testing
or comb for disease identification.

• Queen excluders.

• Entrance reducers.

• Heavy fabric, such as burlap, or extra inner or outer
covers to protect uncovered colonies or supers from
robbing bees.

• Newspaper for uniting colonies.

• Permanent marking pen or pencil.

• Extra queen cages and queen marking paint.

• A sting kit for those allergic to bees (Epipen™), first aid kit and other medications for the beekeeper.

Inspecting a frame of brood.
To inspect a colony you must open it up and look inside (See Working with a Bee Colony). Once inside, pry the outside frame of the brood chamber loose.
Remove the frame from the body and hold it in front
of you with one hand on each end of the top bar. If
possible, position yourself so that the sun is shining
over your shoulder and onto the frame. Observe the
bees and the frame.
Honey bee eggs and young larvae.
Inspect the brood frames for:

• Healthy larvae. Larvae should be pearly white. Gray,
yellow, brown or black larvae are diseased, chilled or
injured.

• Eggs standing in the bottom of cells. Recently laid
eggs will be standing on end in the bottom of cells,
one egg per cell. As they age, they gradually fall to
one side. Two or more eggs on the sides of the cell are
from a laying worker.

• Cell caps of healthy brood. These will be convex and
tan. Cell caps of unhealthy brood are often concave
and perforated with small holes.
A healthy brood frame.
• Area of cells with brood. A prolific queen will have
a laying pattern of brood with very few skipped
cells over most of the frame. The pattern should be
compact and in a semicircle, usually occurring over
the bottom half of the frame.

• Honey and pollen stores. Honey should appear
adjacent to the brood pattern. Adequate honey stores
will vary with colony size. Pollen is stored in cells
adjacent to honey.
Remove and inspect all of the frames that contain
brood. After inspection of a frame, place it in the
hive body toward the side from which you removed
the outside frame. After completing your inspection,
replace the frames in their original order and close the
hive.
When you open a colony for inspection, you
can also perform other tasks necessary for colony
maintenance, such as feeding, treating with antibiotics
or miticides, replacing damaged combs with frames
containing new foundation, adding an empty super or
removing a super of honey. Prepare the items you need
in advance and have them near when you open the
colony.

Items you should bring to the apiary or that you should keep on hand:

Extra hive tool or tools, gloves, veil, bee suit and smoker.
Matches or lighter.
Dry smoker fuel.
Extra frames with drawn comb or new foundation, and extra hive bodies.
Container to collect wax scrapings or propolis.
Jars or sealable bags to collect bees for mite testing or comb for disease identification.
Queen excluders.
Entrance reducers.
Heavy fabric, such as burlap, or extra inner or outer covers to protect uncovered colonies or supers from robbing bees.
Newspaper for uniting colonies.
Permanent marking pen or pencil.
Extra queen cages and queen marking paint.
A sting kit for those allergic to bees (Epipen™), first aid kit and other medications for the beekeeper.

What is a swarm? Swarming is the natural mode
of reproduction for a honey bee colony in spring.
Swarming is induced as bees increase their population
size and require more space. A swarm usually consists
of the old queen (sometimes a new one) and 50 to 60
percent of the worker bees in the swarming colony.
Workers preparing to swarm engorge themselves
on honey and force the old queen out of the hive.
Changing weather conditions from cool and rainy to
warm and sunny seem to stimulate the natural urge of
bees to swarm.Bees on exposed comb.
Most swarms leave the colony in good weather
between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., fly to a nearby tree or
bush and land on a limb. Immediately after landing
and for the next 24 to 36 hours, the bees are very
docile; they are interested in swarming, not in
defending their colony. Scout bees come out of the
cluster of the swarm and search the local area for
a protected location for the colony. The scout bees
communicate the information to the swarm and a
“decision” is made, whereupon the bees leave the
branch and proceed to their new location.
After arriving at the new location, or rarely if
the swarming bees have failed to find a location (see
photo at right), the bees start to build wax comb and the
queen lays eggs to start a new brood nest. After brood
production commences, the new colony will become
defensive of its new home.

Preparing for a “Swarm Call”
As a beekeeper you may be contacted by
neighbors, businesses and the county Extension office
as early as the month of March to go out and collect
a swarm. This request is a “swarm call.” Collecting
a swarm can be exciting, fun and a good way to start
a new colony with less expense. However, you must
be prepared to go and get the swarm at a moment’s
notice, because the swarm may depart quickly, not
“waiting” for you to get ready. You may want to
give your name and phone number to your county
Extension office so that your name can be put on a list
of beekeepers who are willing to retrieve swarms.

A swarm in a pine tree.
• Anticipate the call by finding a container to hold
the swarm (a cardboard box will do, but a hive body
with bottom and top works better); prepare sugar
syrup (1:1 sugar/water) in a squirt bottle; collect
smoker, fuel and matches, a strap to hold lid/top on
container, bee veil and a ladder.

• When the person calls announcing he or she needs
someone to retrieve a swarm, you should tell the
caller not to disturb the swarm or spray it with water,
soap or pesticide.

• The caller may be excited or even alarmed. Calm
the caller by explaining what is happening and that
swarming honey bees are not defensive or dangerous
unless disturbed.

• Explain that a swarm will usually move from the
original location within 24 to 48 hours; therefore, if
a beekeeper is not available to collect the bees from
a homeowner’s property, the bees will normally leave
without causing a problem.

• Ask questions to improve your chance of success in
collecting the swarm.
Questions to Ask about Swarms:

1. Are these really honey bees? Ask them what the
“cluster looks like.” You do not want yellowjackets
or hornets. Has anyone disturbed the cluster?

2. Get permission from the landowner/homeowner to
collect the swarm from his or her property.

3. Be sure to write down the name, address and
phone number, including work number of the
homeowner or someone who will be on site.

4. Ask for directions of how to find the swarm
location, including where on the property.

5. How long have the bees been there?

6. How high off the ground are they? Will you need a
ladder?

7. How big is the swarm (beach ball, football size,
etc.)?

8. Ask the caller if it’s all right (or acceptable) if
you snip a branch of the tree or bush holding the
swarm.


A swarm that’s easy to collect!


How to Collect a Swarm – This Is the Fun Part!
Let’s start with an “ideal swarm” example to start
with. This swarm has formed in a small tree, 5 feet
above level ground in a fenced yard. The homeowner
reports the swarm has been there only 20 minutes.

• Place the whole cluster of bees, including the queen,
directly into an empty hive body or nucleus (smaller
version). This way frames can be gradually added to
this “colony” and there is no need to shift the bees
into a hive later. Some beekeepers like to lay the
cluster down on a sheet in front of the hive and let
the bees walk into the hive on their own. This is your
choice.

• Mist the hanging cluster of bees lightly as well as the
inside surfaces of the hive body and frames (those
that can fit in easily with the swarm) with 1:1 sugar:
water syrup.

• If the bees are clustered on a low branch, snip it and
carefully lower the branch and bees into the hive.

• If it’s not possible to cut the branch, then place the
hive body below and surrounding the bottom of
the cluster, if possible. Then shake the branch to
dislodge the bees into the hive body. If shaking isn’t
an option, then gently brush or scoop the bees with a
gloved hand down into the hive body.

• Add frames gradually to the middle area to fill the
box as bees move up onto frame surfaces.

• Carefully look on the branch for a missed queen and
scoop any clusters gently into the box.

• Crack the lid on the box for a few minutes to allow
stragglers to find the new colony.
You may need to leave the new colony in this
location overnight if many bees are flying around. In
other situations everything happens quickly and you
can put them in and leave within a few minutes. This
may depend, in part, on how long the swarm has been
in this location.
Attach the top to the hive body and secure
window screen in the entrance with staples to keep
bees inside while providing ventilation. Strap the unit
together and move it to the new location.
You will need to modify this method to fit your
unique situation. Not all swarms cluster this close to
the ground on an easy-to-reach branch. You will need
to decide if the swarm is too high or on a structure
that is out of reach for safe retrieval. We have collected
swarms from interesting places such as vehicles,
grocery shopping carts, mailboxes, statues and from
eaves of buildings.

The most common reasons for dividing a colony
are swarm prevention and the need to increase colony
numbers. A strong colony can be divided into two
or three colonies (splits). The number of splits will
depend on the amount of brood present in the parent
colony. For each split, you need three to five frames
of brood and a couple of food frames with pollen and
honey. Be careful not to split a colony too many times
or wait until it’s too late in the year, because the small
colony needs time to build up for winter.
Tip: Lightly misting the frames and bees in the
splits with a 1:1 sugar:water solution will calm the
bees, and occupy them while they get acquainted with
their new home, especially if you intend to mix brood
from one or more colonies to form the split.

4 Dividing a Colony and Requeening with Purchased Queens.


When Should a Colony Be Divided?
A colony can be divided when it has a large
population of bees, at least 10 frames of brood and
appears overcrowded. When you open a crowded
colony, bees tend to “pour over” the top of the
frames. In the spring, a large colony preparing to
swarm is an excellent candidate to divide. Prior to
swarming, a colony produces many (sometimes 10 or
more) queen cells (called swarm cells) on the bottom
portion of frames in the brood area. Once the queen
cells are capped, swarming is imminent unless you
act quickly to “convince” the bees that they have
already swarmed. Dividing the colony is one method
to reduce overcrowding in the brood area and in the
honey storage area as well. Prior to making the splits
you need to determine how many can be made and
how to provide queens for the parent colony and/orsplits. To provide a queen you can use queen cells
or eggs from the parent colony or purchase queens
from a queen producer.


To Divide a Colony with Queen Cells:
1) Set up hive stands and organize all equipment
to be used for the new colony(ies). You will need
bottom, inner and top covers, supers and frames.
If using foundation when there is no honey flow,
you will need to feed sugar syrup (see feeding bees).

2) Open the parent colony with minimum smoke
and find the queen. Place the frame with her in the
new colony. This will give the parent colony the
illusion that the queen has swarmed. Determine
the number of frames of brood and food in the
colony being divided.

3) Place the split without the old queen in the
location of the parent colony. The older foraging
workers will return to the parent colony.

4) Carefully remove brood frames that contain
queen cells to an empty hive body. Queen cells are
easily damaged. Do not leave the frame exposed to
sun and do not turn the queen cells upside down.

5) Place a frame having two or three large, wellshaped
queen cells into the queenless split adjacent
to other brood combs and destroy the queen cells
that you do not need.

6) Place three to five frames of brood near the
center of the super in each new colony and provide
enough bees to completely cover the brood.

7) Add at least one frame of pollen and one frame
of honey, placing them outside the brood.

8) Provide at least two frames of empty drawn
comb (preferred) or two frames of foundation on
the outside of the brood area.

9) Place a super, containing drawn comb or
foundation, above the brood chamber.

10) Add a top feeder if there is no honey flow (see
feeding bees).

11) Do not disturb for 14 days. At this point, check
for a laying queen in both splits.


To Divide a Colony and Produce a Queen from Eggs:
Follow the procedure above; however, rather than
providing splits with queen cells, you will be giving
them frames with eggs to make their own queen. Eight
to 10 days later, check for queen cell formation. Be
careful not to damage the queen cells. At this time,
destroy all but two or three of the largest, best-shaped,
capped queen cells. Do not disturb for 14 days. Then
check for a laying queen.


Dividing a Colony and Requeening with Purchased Queens.
Follow the procedure for dividing as explained
above with these changes/options:

1) If you plan to put new queens in both splits,
order new queens in advance. Place the queen
shipping cage, with the cork removed from the
candy end, between two frames of capped brood in
each queenless colony (see Queen Marking and Requeening).
Return in three days to see if the queen has been
released. If she has been released, do not disturb
for 10 days, then check for a laying queen. If she is
still in the cage, poke a hole through the candy to
speed up her release and check again in three days.

2) If you want to save the old queen, leave her in
the original location and move the split to another
location. When you divide the brood, give the split
more capped brood, because these newly emerged
bees will accept a new queen more readily than
will older workers.

Two methods may be used. The simplest method
is to move the colony in small increments, about
one yard each day. If a colony is moved more than
a yard per day, returning foragers will be confused
and you will lose some of the field bees. The second
method involves removing the colony to a site several
miles away for several days to allow foraging bees to “forget” the old location. Then return the colony
to the new site in the original apiary where they will
“learn,” and become oriented to, the new location.


Secure the Colony before Moving

Colony secured with a locking strap.


Locking straps can be used to secure the
colony for moving. A strap should be placed around
an entire individual colony and tightened firmly.
Additional strapping to secure the colonies within
the transporting vehicle or trailer will be necessary to
prevent movement or shifting during the move. For
ease of use, strapping is the preferred method.
Stapling is another method of securing colonies
for transport. All the outside parts of a beehive are
stapled together with 2 3/4-inch hive staples. Drive
the staples in at the four corners, fastening each part
to the part above and below. This can be done during
the day in preparation for moving in the evening after
dark. Using staples, however, will damage hive bodies,
promote wood decay and agitate the bees during
stapling.
Before moving a hive, remove the surplus supers
of honey down to the brood chamber(s) and one empty
super. Excess honey supers increase weight and make
strapping more difficult.


Ventilate the Bees for the Move

Entrance screen for moving bees.


Remove the inner cover and nail a screened
cooling board over the top to close and ventilate the
top of the hive. A cooling board is a plywood panel the
size of an inner cover with a large, centrally located,
screened window. An inner cover with the center hole
screened can be used for a short distance move. In
cool weather, a cooling board may not be necessary.
To screen the entrance for a short-distance move,
plastic window screen may be stapled across the
entrance. For longer distances, an entrance screen can
be made by constructing a frame with 11⁄2-inch by 1⁄2-
inch pieces of wood that will fit between the bottom
board cleats, against the front of the hive body to
cover the entrance. The bottom of the frame is made
with a 3/4-inch piece to cover without blocking the
entrance. The frame is covered with metal window
screen wire. The screened frame encloses a screened
porch on the front of the hive. Air will circulate
through the entrance and out the top to keep the bees
cool in transit.


When to Move a Colony
Moving at nighttime is best, because all the
field bees should be in the colony. A daytime move,
especially a long-distance one, would result in the loss
of foraging bees returning to the old location. The
bees will return to the hive at dusk or a little later.
Have everything in place except the entrance screen.
Attach the entrance screen with two wood screws
through the two end bars and load the colony for
moving to a new location.
Place the colony on a base at the new location.
Smoke the entrance and remove the screen. Place the
inner and outer covers on the hive.
The bees will fill the combs and cap the honey
when they have cured it to approximately 18 percent
or less water. Some of the frames of honey may not
be capped until several days after the nectar flow
has stopped. The frames and supers of honey that
are capped can be removed from the colony. Avoid
harvesting honey in uncapped cells. It is likely to
be too high in moisture content and will ferment in
storage without additional drying.
Extract soon after removing super from the hive.
Honey must be extracted within three to four days
after removal from the hive to prevent damage by wax
moths or small hive beetles. Be prepared to extract
the honey when you remove the super from the hive.
If extraction is not possible within three or four days,
frames of honey can be stored below 32 degrees F for
long periods of time without danger of crystallization.
Open the colony and inspect the supers of honey.
Frames of capped and uncapped honey can be
exchanged between supers. The super of honey may
contain many bees. Do not use smoke to drive the bees
out of the super; excessive use of smoke may taint the
flavor of the honey.

2 If You Find Brood in Honey Supers
3 Avoid Robbing


Methods to Remove Bees from Honey Supers
To harvest a small amount of honey, you can
simply shake bees from individual frames. On the
ground near the colony, place an empty super inside
an outer cover turned bottom side up. An inner cover
with a bee escape (see Bee Escapes below), a flat piece
of plywood or an outer cover is needed to cover the
super as you place the frames of honey that are free of
bees into the super. Remove a frame of honey from the
super of honey taken from the colony. Hold the frame
by the ends of the top bar in front of the colony a short
distance above the entrance. One or two short, strong
shakes will dislodge all the bees. Immediately place
the frame into the empty super and cover the super to
prevent the bees from returning to the frame. Shake
the bees from the remaining frames and load the
super, keeping it completely covered except to insert
the frames of honey. This method can be used very
effectively with a small number of colonies. To remove
bees from entire supers, you can use a bee repellent, a
blower or bee escapes.


BEE REPELLANTS
These repellents, such as Bee Go™, are aromatic
liquids of butyric anhydride that are sprinkled in
small quantities onto a fume board, which is placed on
the top of supers. As the repellent evaporates, the odor
will drive the bees out of the super within minutes.
The fume board consists of an absorbent cloth or pad
stapled onto a wooden frame or spare inner cover.
The cloth side is placed on top of the super. Warming
an outer cover for a few minutes in the sun before
covering the fume board will accelerate the process.


AIR BLOWERS
Blowers may be purchased from beekeeping
supply vendors to remove bees from honey supers.
A blower is made for this purpose. Or, you can use a
blower made for home and garden use. A super must
be held upright on its side while air is blown between
the frames. Bees may be difficult to dislodge. Also, the
noise and smell of the blower may irritate bees and
make them more defensive.


BEE ESCAPES
Escapes provide a more passive method of bee
removal. The Porter® bee escape fits into the center
hole of an inner cover to allow bees to exit a super, but
not to re-enter it. The inner cover with bee escape is
placed between the honey supers and the brood nest.
This method works best on cool nights when bees
move down to the brood nest. Escapes usually must
be left on colonies for at least two days to insure all or
most bees have been removed.


If You Find Brood in Honey Supers
A queen may expand the brood nest up into the
honey supers. Check all supers of honey to be removed
for presence of brood. Locate the queen and return
her to the brood nest below. Exchange frames with
brood for frames of capped honey, consolidating all
of the brood into one super. Honey stored in brood
frames is food for the bees and should not be packed
for human consumption. Place the super with brood
on top of the brood chamber. Place a queen excluder
over the hive bodies containing brood to prevent the
queen from re-entering honey supers.


Avoid Robbing
Keep all frames and supers of honey sealed
during honey removal. During removal, stack supers
filled with honey between outer covers on top and
bottom to prevent robbing bees and other insects
from reaching the honey. For transport, honey supers
should be well secured. Locking straps work well for
transporting supers.

Insulating colonies for winter can be worth the cost and effort in cold climates by insreasing winter survival. Here is one method to prepare colonies for winter:

If you know how many bees were in your sample, you can estimate the number of mites per 100 bees. If there is brood in the colony when you sample, you should double this number to factor in the amount of mites in worker brood. For example, if there are 5 mites / 100 bees, the total infestation is probably 10 mites/100 bees. If your colony has over 10-12 mites/100 bees, you should consider treatment.

Follow these 10 easy steps to determine the infestation level of varroa mites in a honey bee colony.

1. The first step is to make a container with a cover made of 8×8 hardware cloth. An easy method is to use a wide-mouth canning jar. Use a ring type cover. Cut a circle of 8×8 hardware cloth the size of the cover that fits in the ring and use it instead of the cover.


A wide-mouth canning jar with a cover made of 8×8 hardware cloth


2. You will also need something white to shake the mites and powdered sugar into. You can just shake them onto a piece of paper if it is not windy. A white container works best but any light color (yellow) would be ok.

3. Shake about 200-400 bees into the container. You can shake the bees from a frame into a bent piece of sheet metal (flashing) to help pour them into the container.


Remove a frame from the brood area to take a sample of bees for varroa mite sampling.


4. 1 fluid oz. = approximately 100 bees. 1/4 cup = approximately 200 bees. You will have to shake the bees in, then tap the bottom of the container to get all the bees on the bottom of the container to measure them.

5. With the bees in the container place the 8×8 screen on top and secure.


Put about 2 Tablespoons of powdered sugar into container.


6. Put about 2 Tablespoons of powdered sugar into container. Shake the bees with the powdered sugar until they are well coated. Let the container sit for about 1-2 minutes.

7. Tip the container upside down over the white container and shake the powdered sugar and mites out through the screen.

8. Continue to shake for at least one minute to be sure you have all of the mites.


The mites show up easier on a white background.


9. Count the number of mites in the powdered sugar. If you have trouble seeing them you can add a small amount of water to dissolve the sugar, making the mites easier to see.

10. Return the bees to their colony.The bees will survive. Once they are cleaned up they can go back to work.
We feel that the advantages of marking the
queen outweigh the disadvantages. A queen marked
with bright colored paint is easier to find. You
know the marked queen is one you introduced, not
a supersedure of unknown quality. You also know
her age. Younger queens are more prolific layers and
produce more pheromone that maintains colony
cohesion, thus making the colony less prone to
swarming and less susceptible to stressful conditions.

How to Mark a Queen
• Practice with drones until you have confidence that
you can do it without damaging the drone. You do
not want to squeeze the abdomen or thorax and you
do not want to drop the queen.

• Be prepared: have enamel paint and a helper’s extra
pair of hands ready, if needed, to hold the frame,
unscrew cap from paint bottle, etc. If alone, shake
paint and unscrew cap.


Marking a queen.


• Grasp queen by the wings between forefinger and
thumb of left hand so that her legs are suspended.

• Place the forefinger of the right hand (nail side down)
below her legs and she will quickly rest her legs on it.

• Move the thumb of right hand on top of and trapping
at least two legs (right side) with enough pressure to
hold her (see photo). If you have the legs secure she
will stop moving.

• Release wings with left hand.

• If alone, daub the paint onto the center of the thorax
only and hold her gently for 30 seconds to one
minute before putting her back on the frame from
which she was taken. Insert the frame back into the
colony.

• If a helper is available to daub paint, add your left
thumb to trap additional legs of the queen (left side)
and have the helper daub the paint on the queen’s
thorax.


Requeening
Why Requeen? Better Performance – Better Production
Most beekeepers requeen every year to take
advantage of the better egg-laying performance
and productivity of the young queen. A queen may
lay for several years, but 99 per cent of queens are
most prolific for the first year and decline during the
second year, with performance falling drastically
thereafter. A colony with an older queen is more likely
to swarm than one with a young queen. Colonies
with more prolific, young queens are less likely to be
overwhelmed by parasitic mites. An inferior queen
results in an inferior colony.
If you let the colony requeen itself, you may end
up with an inferior queen. Smaller, less vigorous
queens usually hatch out first and destroy larger
queens in their queen cells before they emerge.
A queen needs to mate with 12 or more drones
over a one- or two-day period to accumulate the 5
million sperm she will need throughout her life. If the
weather during her mating flights is cold or rainy, then
drones may be scarce, resulting in less mating. This
queen may run out of sperm later in the season and no
longer lay worker eggs.
A virgin queen may mate with drones of
inferior stock, resulting in a colony with poor honey
production, increased tendency to swarm or one that
exhibits excessive defensive behavior.
Consider requeening if the colony exhibits
one or more of the following: unexplained low bee
population, excessive propolis production, laying
workers, defensiveness, high swarming tendency, poor
honey production or excessive drone production.


When to Requeen?
A colony can be requeened at any time during the
warm season, but requeening is most successful when
a nectar flow is on. Routine requeening is usually done
in spring or late summer. We suggest requeening early
in August, but let’s examine why spring requeening is
also an option.


THE ADVANTAGES OF SPRING REQUEENING:
• The old queen is easier to find due to smaller bee
populations.

• Nectar/honey flows usually occur in spring.
Requeening during a honey flow increases
acceptance, and reduces robbing and defensiveness.


THE DISADVANTAGES OF SPRING REQUEENING:
• Inclement spring weather in Tennessee may confine
bees, causing them to eat their stores and increase
chance of queen supersedure.

• Spring rains and cool temperatures may prohibit
opening the colony to install a new queen.

• If swarming has begun, you can miss capped queen
cells as well as virgin queens that may be present or
may be returning from mating.

• Queens from queen producers may be of inferior
quality due to poor weather conditions for mating in
queen production areas.


THE ADVANTAGES OF AUGUST REQUEENING:
• Colony starts the winter with young healthy bees and
a new queen.

• Colony less likely to swarm next spring with a young
queen.

• Spring population should be higher with a younger
queen laying more in late winter and early spring
than an old queen.

• Queens are less expensive to purchase than in spring.

• There is a break in the brood cycle, which can reduce
disease and pest problems.

• If this queen fails, then you still have time to try
again before cool fall weather.


THE DISADVANTAGES OF AUGUST REQUEENING:
• Harder to find old queen with large bee population.

• If no honey flow is on, then bees will be more
defensive and prone to robbing.

• If no honey flow is on, then you need to feed all
colonies in the apiary where you are requeening.
If you feed only the requeened colonies, the strong
colonies nearby will rob them.

• May take more time if bees start robbing the colony
being requeened, because you must stop working
and come back later after robbing ceases.


Queen Introduction – Direct or Indirect?
Although many procedures have been described
about how to install a queen, they can be classified as
either direct or indirect.

With direct methods the queen is released directly
into the colony, usually in combination with smoke,
scented sugar syrup or honey. The new queen and
the colony to receive the queen are both treated with
smoke, scented sugar syrup or honey to mask any
difference in odor between her and the colony.
Indirect methods of queen introduction using
shipping cages are more preferred by most beekeepers.
Some beekeepers use push-in cages and others use a
division screen method.


Benton cage and JZ BZ cage.
Many queen producers still ship their queens to
beekeepers in the wooden “Benton cage.” This cage
has three circular cavities covered by screen, openings
on either end that are plugged by corks. The cavity on
one end of the cage is filled with sugar candy (fondant,
a mixture of powdered sugar and water in a doughlike
consistency). The plastic “JZ BZ” queen cage is
preferred by some queen package producers.
The new laying queen is normally shipped with
six attendant bees inside the cage to take care of her.
When you receive the queens in the mail, inspect
them to make sure they are alive. Add a couple drops
of water to each cage on the screen, away from the
candy end, to let the bees get water. New research
suggests that the attendants should be removed before
introducing the queen because they interfere with
acceptance.
One way to safely remove attendants is to do it
in a closed room with a window. You can wrap the
cage except for the corked end without candy with
a cloth, then remove the cork, making this opening
the only place where light can enter. The workers and
sometimes the queen will be attracted to light and
come out. The quickest method is to turn off room
lights, remove the screen and let all bees y to the
“lighted” window. Then replace the screen and put
only the queen back inside.


Installing a Queen in a Shipping Cage:
• Locate the old queen and remove her from the
colony. If you have difficulty finding queens, place
queen excluders between supers with brood for four
days before requeening. This will confine the queen
to one box. While searching for the queen, search
also for eggs. The queen will be in the box where
you find eggs, because eggs laid before you added
excluders have hatched.


Installing a queen in a shipping cage.


• Remove the cork from the candy end of the cage.
One purpose of the candy is to delay immediate
release of the new queen. In the two days (usually)
that the workers take to eat the candy and release
the queen, her odors and that of her attendants have
blended in with that of the colony. A new queen and
her attendants have a different odor than that of the
new colony and they may be treated aggressively if
they are released too soon.

• Press the side of the cage with the candy end up
vertically into the middle of a frame of brood and
move the adjacent frame of brood to “sandwich” the
cage perpendicular, in between.

• Putting the candy end up keeps any attendant bees
(if included) from blocking the hole if they should
die. If the candy end were down, dead attendants
could block the queen’s exit.

• Wait three days before inspecting to determine if the
queen is released. If she is not out and much candy
remains or it is too hard, carefully poke a small hole
through the candy to speed the process.

• Wait 10 days to search for her, and more importantly,
for eggs, which indicate she is laying and has been
accepted into the colony.


Installing a Queen Using Press-in Cages.

wire press-in queen introduction cage.


A press-in cage is a screen box with an open side
made of eight-mesh (1/8- inch squares) screen, 4 inches
by 4 inches, with each edge bent upward at a 90-degree
angle to form a side that is 1 inch wide. The open side
of the box is pressed over the queen on a capped brood
frame that is about to emerge. No adult bees should
be trapped under the cage with the queen. A few cells
of honey should also be under the cage. New workers
hatch out under the cage, take care of the queen and
clean cells where she lays eggs. The cage is removed
when eggs are found. During this several-day process,
the queen and workers acclimate to one another and
the queen is readily accepted. Caution: Make sure you
put the cage over comb without holes. Workers can
crawl through holes to get inside the cage before it’s
time to release the queen.

Vigorous well-nourished colonies are able to withstand bee diseases and parasites better than poorly nourished colonies. Scientists have emphasized that malnutrition may be playing a key role in the decline of colonies due to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Honey bees can suffer from a compromised immune system related to poor nutrition.


Natural Forage
Healthy bees require a diversity of natural pollen.
Placing bees on locations with abundant and diverse floral resources will help them stay healthy.
Locations vary in their carrying capacity, and experience will suggest optimum densities.
Placing too many bees in one location will result in inadequate floral resources, robbing, drifting and the spread of bee diseases and parasites.

Supplemental Feeding
Forage can be limited in late summer and fall. When floral resources are inadequate, feeding bees sugar syrup and pollen substitutes can improve colony survival and performance.
Supplemental feeding is critical to build bees for early almond pollination by Feb. 1st.

A good protein source is very important for strong colonies

Provide protein pollen patties.
Pollen substitutes should have three (3) essential properties:

Consumable – honey bees should be readily able to eat and consume the supplemental feed;
Absorbable – honey bees should be able to digest and absorb the supplemental feed, and;
Nutritious – it should contain the necessary and vital ingredients for bee health.
Place pollen patties between brood boxes or on top of hive frames.
It is critical to provide supplemental feed when colonies arrive for almond pollination; dearth is a factor prior to and after bloom.
For more information see Honey_Bee_Nutrition


Provide plentiful and abundant water

Water
Provide plentiful and abundant water.
Pesticides, fungicides and fertilizers may drift into water sources; locate colonies near colonies near accessible clean water.
Drought causes honey bee stress. Work with your grower on identifying a potable water source for bees to avoid dehydration.
 

The Beekeeper’s Goal:

Provide bees a diversity of natural pollen.
When possible, locate natural forage for your bees.
Fall is a critical time to build bees for almond pollination.
Provide supplemental feed, especially protein, to build strong, 8-frame colonies by Feb. 1st.
Water is just as important as food; keep your bees well-hydrated with clean water.
 


2.Best Management Practices for Pest/Varroa Control
Controlling pests, particularly Varroa, is a critically important management practice.


Why is Varroa harmful to Honey Bees?
Varroa mites reduce individual bee and colony vigor by feeding on their haemolymph. In addition, they vector viruses and facilitate infection by other bee pathogens.


Manage for Varroa control
Varroa control should be a primary activity in your beekeeping operation.
Requeen with mite resistant stock. Using stock selected for resistance may aid in slowing down the growth of Varroa populations.

Sticky board mite trap

Do your colonies have Varroa mites?
Monitoring is important, early detection is key.
Check often, every 2-3 months.
Conduct a random sampling of hives.
Follow regional guidelines for action thresholds.

How to check for Varroa
Sticky Boards for an accurate mite count
Alcohol Wash
Sugar/Ether Roll

How to treat for Varroa
Use biotechnical methods to suppress mite populations if action is necessary when surplus honey is being produced.
Drone brood removal
Powdered sugar dusting
Screened bottom boards
If honey is not being produced, use thymol-based materials or organic acids.
Exercise judicious treatment and soft chemicals.
Follow the recommended label instructions.
Rotate treatments to prevent resistance.
Varroa mites have exhibited resistance to some varroacides in some regions. Check with your local cooperative extension office or apiary inspector to find out which varroacides are most effective in your area.
Be aware that strong colonies in mid-summer can be highly infested with Varroa and even strong colonies can crash in population in late-summer and fall.

Are your treatments working?
Recheck for efficacy; don’t assume your treatments are working.
Varroa is a community problem. Work with your beekeeper neighbors to be sure that all beekeepers are keeping Varroa at low levels.

Minimize toxin exposure
Honey bees have a limited capacity to metabolize toxins, including beekeeper-applied varroacides, and some toxins can accumulate in beeswax combs.
Be aware of crop pest control practices near your apiary; know the risks and have a plan for protecting colonies.
Varroacides can tie up bees’ detoxification capabilities and render them less able to deal with other varroacides and chemicals used on crops.
Avoid treating bees with varroacides when they are likely to be exposed to crop pest control chemicals.
Renew beeswax combs by replacing a few combs from each hive annually
 

The Beekeeper’s Goal:

A good management program pays close attention to mite levels.
Varroa can rebound quickly; watch your threshold levels closely.
Constant monitoring and timely treatment is critical for healthy hives.
 


3. Best Management Practices for Disease Control/Nosema
Evidence suggests that presence of Nosema is contributing to honey bee health problems.

Why is Nosema harmful to Honey Bees?

Scientists agree that Nosema ceranae is the most prevalent and economically damaging of the honey bee diseases. In serious cases of Nosema, the colony may eventually die.


Do your colonies have Nosema?
It’s important to monitor your bees for Nosema (N. apis and N. ceranae) – early detection is key – and treat to reduce levels if warranted.
Monitor Nosema levels and colony condition.
Check often, ideally monthly.
Random sampling of hives

How to check for Nosema
Collect live or fresh dead bees from the hive entrance or from top bars of the frames.
On-site microscopic examination of honey bee gut for spore count.
When levels exceed 1 million spores per bee, colonies can exhibit dwindling, but this will not always be the case.

How to treat for Nosema

Chemical control with Fumagillin
Practice judicious treatment.
Follow proper preparation, storage and application.

Hygiene
Clean comb
Clean or replace contaminated equipment.

Nutrition
Good “Fall Flow” of natural or wild forage, proper nutrition eases stress.
Strong immune system = healthy bees.
Treat based on your risk assessment and previous experience.


Are your treatments working?
Recheck for efficacy
Don’t assume
 

The Beekeeper’s Goal

Watch your Nosema levels; Nosema can appear quickly.
Be aware that Nosema in the presence of high mite levels can compromise colony health.
Constant monitoring and treatment are critical for healthy hives.
 


4. Best Management Practices for Hive Equipment
A well-maintained and orderly apiary can translate into a successful beekeeping operation.

Why practice diligent hive maintenance?

Beekeepers agree that the most important piece of equipment in the apiary is the beehive, the home of the honey bee.


Hive Maintenance
Proper maintenance extends the life of the hive.
Check apiary for hive condition.
Inspect for rotten, loose or broken boards and frames.
Reconstruct, tighten or replace frame parts.
Paint supers with light colors to beat summer heat.
Take advantage of the winter months to do maintenance and prepare for the new season.
Check bee attire.

Repair clothes, veil, gloves and bodysuit.
Inspect your essential two (2) pieces of equipment.

Smoker and the hive or “universal” tool
Maintain yard equipment.

Inspect and repair trucks, trailers, loaders and forklifts.
Repair bunkhouses, if applicable.
Eliminate trash in the apiary.
Practice fire safety when the bee smoker is in use.

Hygiene
Practice good hygiene with hands, gloves, and other equipment to reduce transmission of pathogens between colonies.
Replace comb with new foundation to minimize residual chemicals in old wax.
Develop a comb replacement schedule.
Purchase equipment only if it has a history of clean health.

Hive Security
Be aware that the probability of hive theft has increased with the increased value of pollinating crops.
Keep equipment simple to identify.
ID hives with a brand or name.
Secure a signed contract when entering into a “wintering deal.”
Practice discretion when showing where your yards are located.
The Beekeeper’s Goal

Keep your equipment in good condition.
Good maintenance prolongs the life of hive parts, clothing, vehicles, and other equipment.
Good hygiene reduces the incidences of pests and diseases.
Hive security can minimize economic losses.
 


Best Management Practices for Colony Management
Successful beekeepers employ practices that are tested and proved to be profitable.

Exert you energy wisely

Invest time, money and energy on your healthy colonies.
Practice judicious methods

Maintain a reserve; don’t commit all your colonies to contract.

healthy brood frame
 


Monitor colony strength
Cull weak colonies.
Use diagnostic services for objective colony assessment.
Check frames of brood for intended strength to coincide with almond bloom.
Be mindful of colony placement to minimize stress.
Do not combine weak collapsing colonies with healthy colonies.

Managing Stock
Maintain genetic quality to meet your objectives:
Maintain stocks that are productive and disease and pest resistant.
Encourage high drone densities to provide well-mated queens and genetically diverse colonies.
Discourage stocks that are excessively defensive.
Select stock by propagating colonies that prosper when other colonies exhibitsymptoms of stress.
Requeen colonies, at least annually. Package bees typically exhibit low Varroa and virus levels during the year following installation. Consider making colony increases by shaking package bees from your own colonies.

Water

Consider water access when transporting colonies and when placing colonies in the orchard.
The Beekeeper’s Goal

Work towards strong 8-frame colonies for almond pollination by Feb. 1st.
Invest your energy in the expectation of future returns and benefits.
Use discretion to avoid waste.
Employ genetics, diagnostic services and placement of hives to ensure healthy colonies.
 


6. Best Management Practices for Business Management
Beekeeping is an evolving profession.


 
Be professional in your beekeeper/grower interactions.

Use a Contract (See a Sample Pollination Contract at http://www.ProjectApism.org under ‘Downloads’).
Determine pollination fees that are realistic relative to your operation costs.
Use well-maintained equipment.
Be dependable with the timing of hive drops and pick-ups.
Be visible to your growers.
Develop contingency plans for the unexpected.
Be efficient

Streamline your business to manage resources wisely.
Keep good records to improve practices.
Keep learning

Successful beekeeping is a rapidly changing art and science.
Join local, state, regional and national organizations.
Attend conferences.
Access the internet, watch for reliable sources of information.
Subscribe to bee journals.
Regularly check the CAP project website for new information at http://www.beeccdcap.uga.edu/index.html.
Give back

Beekeeping needs ideas and leadership to build a prosperous future.
Mentor new and young beekeepers.
Support and contribute to bee research to ensure a sustainable pollination industry.
 


7. Best Management Practices for Almond Growers Renting Bees
Growers can help beekeepers in the pollination process of their crops.


Nutrition
If possible, help your beekeeper locate flowering forage prior to and after almond bloom.

Plant a cover crop on adjacent land:
At perimeter of orchard
Within younger orchards
On fallow land
Good examples of alternative food resources are mustard, clover or vetch.

Water
Water is important to prevent dehydration.
Provide abundant and potable water, free from contamination.
Landings and screens make water accessible and prevent bee drownings.

Access and Placement
Beekeepers need to place, service and remove hives routinely.

The distribution of colonies should be accessible and convenient at all times.
Orchard roads should be maintained and graded for easy access.
Allow hive placement in areas not prone to flooding or shade.
Eastern and southern exposures are better for sun and warmer temperatures and encourage bee flight for pollination.
Let bees do their job, place hives as to limit human and honey bee interaction.

Agricultural Sprays
Let your beekeeper know the agricultural products used for crop protection, including tank mixes.
Application and Timing

Honey bees come in contact with agricultural sprays in different ways:
Bees may fly through the spray.
Sprays may drift to hives via wind.
Bees may collect and bring into the hive pollen that contains chemical residue.
Management practices to minimize contact are:
Spray when bees are not flying.
Spray when pollen is not being produced by the tree.
Time applications at night or when bees are not flying.

Communication
Keep in contact with your beekeeper, especially prior to almond bloom.
Inquire about supplemental feeding through the winter.
Ask about colony collapses, Varroa infestations, honey crop, over-wintering.
Location, transportation and other factors can positively or negatively affect the strength of the colonies.
Negotiate rental fee, number of colonies per acre, frames of bees per colony, and payment schedule.
Discuss timing of hive placement prior to bloom and pick up after bloom.

Pollination Contracts
A signed contract protects both grower and beekeeper.
Visit Downloads at http://www.ProjectApism.org/ for a pollination contract template.
Secure contracts early for the following season so beekeepers will make the investment in colony health and strength.
When colonies arrive in the orchard, check colony strength; 8 to 10 frames is optimum.
An objective third party inspection of colonies will confirm if contractual obligations have been met.
Allow your beekeeper time and opportunity to provide additional colonies if needed.
Walk your orchard during honey bee flight hours to make sure you see plenty of bee activity.

Honey bees produce or collect a variety of products that benefit people. These products include honey, beeswax, pollen, royal jelly, and propolis (a sticky resin collected from buds and used as a glue in the hive). Although honey bees can be managed to produce large quantities of these products, they are even more valued for the major role they play in pollination, especially of our agricultural crops. While other insects, birds, and bats also are pollinators, people have little control over the actions or numbers of these pollinators. Honey bee colonies, however, can be easily moved and placed wherever and whenever they are needed for pollination.
Also, honey bees have additional advantages over other pollinators such as their availability in large numbers and their instinctive pollen-hoarding behavior. Without the pollinating service of honey bees, the cost of many fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds would be many times what it is today.
About 150,000 beekeepers manage approximately 2.5 million colonies of honey bees in the United States. Beekeepers derive income from their bees in a variety of ways. Some move their colonies several times during the season to produce a variety of honey crops and/or to pollinate various crops for a fee (apples, peaches, blueberries, or pumpkins, for instance). Some stationary beekeepers have apiaries in good honey-producing locations and make honey crops without moving their bees.
Other beekeepers sell equipment, nucleus colonies, and/ or package bees or rear and sell queens as a source of income. However, the majority of individuals keeping bees today maintain a small number of hives for enjoyment and/or the production of honey for home use and pollination of home gardens and orchards.
Around 175 million pounds of honey are produced annually in the United States. Honey is priced according to its color (water white, extra white, white, extra light amber, light amber, and dark amber), with recent wholesale prices ranging from $1.50 to $2.00 per pound in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. About 3.9 million pounds of beeswax, worth about $7 million, are also produced annually as a by-product of the honey harvest.
Producing honey for profit is highly dependent on successful marketing. You should conduct market research to determine your competition, the amount of honey you can sell, and in what form(s) your customers prefer their honey.
Successful marketing of honey requires a well-organized marketing plan consisting of at least the following:
●	Production of high-quality honey
●	Attractive containers and labels
●	An effective advertising program
●	Dependable service for customers
Most honey in the United States is extracted and sold as liquid honey. However, honey can be prepared and marketed in five different ways:
●	Extracted honey
●	Section-comb honey
●	Cut-comb honey
●	Chunk honey
●	Finely crystallized or creamed honey
Equipment needs vary depending on the type and quantity of honey you wish to produce. Extracted liquid honey is the most profitable to produce under conditions where honey flows are generally light. Beekeepers who do not want to invest in extracting equipment can produce cut-comb honey, which is relatively easy to process. Section-comb honey, however, requires more equipment, close attention to colony management, and more frequent manipulation of bees than the production of extracted honey. In addition, beeswax--particularly crafted beeswax products (candles, ornaments, etc.)--is becoming an important source of income for some beekeepers.
Markets for honey and bee products are extensive. You should plan to start small and expand as market demand increases and you develop a better understanding of the markets for your products. For detailed marketing information and useful resources, contact the National Honey Board (see the "For More Information" section).

About 3.9 million pounds of beeswax, worth about $7 million, are also produced annually as a by-product of the honey harvest.
Planning Ahead
Good planning is an important part of successful beekeeping. New beekeepers need to consider the following before purchasing honey bees and the necessary equipment to keep them and produce honey:
●	Number of colonies you will start with
●	Location of your apiary and the amount of site preparation that will be necessary
●	How and where you will purchase your bees (package bees and nucleus colonies should be ordered the fall prior to the spring they are needed)
●	Equipment needed (such as hives for bees, protective equipment for the beekeeper, and honey-processing equipment) and where you will purchase it
●	Amount you can spend (your budget)
●	Amount of time you have to devote to a beekeeping enterprise
●	Local and state laws concerning the keeping of bees
●	Potential markets for your honey, beeswax, or other products
●	Registration of honey bee colonies with your state department of agriculture
●	Registration of your honey-extracting facility (this is now required in some states like Pennsylvania, even if you extract in a kitchen or structure such as a garage)
●	A plan for control of Varroa mites and other diseases
The number of colonies you start with will depend on whether you are planning to keep bees simply for your own enjoyment and use, as a sideline for generating additional income, or as a commercial venture. Many sideline and commercial beekeepers started out keeping bees as a hobby. If you are a beginning beekeeper, you should start small and let your operation grow with your enthusiasm and experience. New beekeepers often want to start with a single colony, but it is better to begin with at least two or three colonies. While the initial cost is higher, the time required to manage two colonies is no greater than the time required to care for one, and some of the management problems you may face can be corrected with the assistance of a second or third colony.
Requirements for successful honey production
●	Strong colonies
●	Young queens (preferably selected for mite resistance)
●	Minimal swarming
●	Good locations with plentiful food resources and strong nectar flow
Marketing
Honey

For detailed marketing information and useful resources, contact the National Honey Board (see the "For More Information" section).
Pollination
Renting hives to growers for pollination services can be an important source of income for beekeepers. Contact fruit and vegetable grower organizations, your state or local beekeeping association, your local county extension educator, or university beekeeping specialist to inform them of your interest in renting your colonies for pollination. To avoid misunderstandings, it is important for beekeepers and growers to have a written agreement when honey bee colonies are being rented for pollination services.
Overwintered or established colonies cost the most, but they can be a good buy. Before you can purchase the bees, they should be inspected by a state bee inspector to ensure that they are disease free. Avoid weak colonies and dilapidated equipment.

Package bees are caged worker bees with a queen, produced mainly in the southern United States by beekeepers who specialize in producing package bees. They consist of 2, 3, or 5 pounds of bees, a queen (in a separate queen cage), and a canister of sugar syrup used for food by the bees during transport. The 3-pound package is often the best buy. Package bees should be ordered in the fall to ensure delivery by the desired early spring date. Packages are shipped in special screen mailing cages through the U.S. Postal Service or other package delivery services. Another option for beekeepers is to contact someone who will transport the bees for a fee. Beekeepers sometimes travel to bring package bees home for many beekeepers at once. Check newsletters to see if anyone is offering this service.

Swarms are another way to get started. Swarms can be easily collected and placed in prepared equipment. It is wise to requeen swarms as soon as possible since old queens head most swarms.

Bees are subject to certain diseases, parasites, predators, and pests. Most pests and predators of bees are easy to control, but diseases and two recently introduced parasitic mites are a great threat to the industry. Diseases may be grouped into two categories: those affecting the brood, and those affecting the adult bees.

Brood diseases can be harmful and include American foulbrood (AFB), European foulbrood (EFB), sacbrood, and chalkbrood. The prevalence of American foulbrood makes it difficult to profitably keep bees unless this disease is monitored and controlled when identified. Adult diseases include virus and nosema. Most states have laws prohibiting the keeping of AFB-infected colonies or selling or removing infected bees or equipment. In most states, inspectors are authorized to enter any place where bees are kept to examine hives, bees, and equipment. Inspectors are authorized to prescribe treatment of diseased colonies and order the destruction of those in which the disease is too far advanced to warrant treatment.

Due to vigorous disease-control programs, beekeepers suffer few major problems with diseases. The biggest obstacle facing beekeepers today is the presence of two kinds of parasitic mites. Mites and the diseases associated with them were not found in the United States until the early 1980s. During the fall and winter, these mites can cause high mortality rates in bee colonies if not properly treated. Beekeeping, whether for fun or profit, is no longer possible without close attention to mite control.

The Varroa mite is considered by many to be the most serious honey bee pest. This mite is an external parasite that is visible to the naked eye. The brownishred, oval (shaped like a tiny clamshell) mite feeds on the blood of both adult bees and the brood. Heavy parasitism by Varroa mites results in bee mortality, subsequent weakening of colonies, and often death.

The tracheal mite is an internal parasitic mite that lives and reproduces within the thoracic tracheae, or breathing tubes, of adult honey bees. These microscopic mites penetrate the tracheae of honey bees and feed on their blood. Feeding by the mites damages the tracheal walls, which blocks the bees' breathing passages. These breathing tubes supply the flight muscles with oxygen. As a result of mite feeding, the flight muscles may atrophy, and the bees may be unable to fly or control their body temperature. Pathogens also may be introduced into the bees' bloodstream by feeding mites.

Efforts to stop the spread of these two mites have been largely unsuccessful, but research into various chemical controls and alternative control techniques, such as the use of resistant stocks, look promising. For more information on parasitic mite control, contact your county extension office or your university beekeeping specialist or visit the MAAREC website.

According to a 2007 report by the National Academies of Science, most North American pollinators, including honey bees, are in decline. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is the most recent manifestation of an overall long-term decline in the managed honey bee population. CCD is characterized by the demise of honey bee colonies as a result of the rapid loss of the adult bee population. Typically, these colonies have healthy-looking brood and adequate food stores. Multiple possible causes of CCD are being studied. A combination of factors including mites, diseases, use of pesticides, environmental stresses, and migratory beekeeping may also be the cause.

Depending on where bees are kept, bears can be a serious hindrance to successful beekeeping. In areas where bears are known to be present, the construction of an electric fence enclosing the apiary is highly recommended before the bees are acquired. Additional pests that may need to be addressed include hive beetles, mice, skunks, opossums, and wax moths.

You may now insure your honey, pollen collection, wax, and breeding stock through a crop insurance program for apiculture. The new grid-based rainfall index apiculture group-risk policy is available in selected states and counties (including all counties in Pennsylvania). Advantages of this coverage include flexibility of when to insure during the year and how much to insure (you are not required to insure all your colonies). This allows you to adjust coverage to better match the value of your beekeeping enterprise. Payments for losses under this program are based on lack of rainfall as measured by a rainfall index within a geographic grid (approximately 12 by 12 miles in area).
You can also insure your income from beekeeping and any other agricultural enterprises you may have using AGR-Lite. AGR-Lite is a whole-farm policy that covers all your crops and is based on your farm's gross revenue as reported on your federal taxes. To use AGR-Lite you must have five years of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Schedule F forms. If your business structure is either a C or an S corporation, the necessary information can be entered into a Schedule F for crop insurance purposes.
Much of beekeeping is simple observation and response. If you are a novice beekeeper, inspect the hive about once a week for a couple of months so that you can learn. Once you feel comfortable, adjust your routine to every two weeks. Make sure the outside of the hive is clean and free of bee poop, the landing board is free of litter, and there are no ants on the hive. Open the hives and check frames for larvae and eggs (on warm days only). If the queen is healthy, you will see plenty of larvae in various stages of development. 
If you don’t see evidence of a healthy queen, consult an expert. Your local beekeeping guild is a good source.
Ultimately, the less often you inspect the hive, the better for its health. Opening the hives and thoroughly checking them requires smoking to keep the bees calm. This stresses the bees and it takes them about a day to recover. As you learn more, you will find you won’t need to pull many frames to know what is going on inside. And you will figure out a lot simply by observing the bees as they come and go from the hive.
Varroa mites are the pest most typically found in hives. Left unchecked, they can cripple and eventually kill the hive (see Pest Control, below, for hints about checking for mites and mite control). Other pests you need to watch for include the small hive beetle and the wax moth. Diseases you need to be on the lookout for are American and European foulbrood. Early intervention can often mean the difference between a healthy hive and a dead hive.

Start with one deep hive body-brood box. When the bees have filled it with 7 or 8 frames of bees and brood, top it with a second brood box. Let the bees build up brood cells in the second brood box, too. When the second brood box is well filled (7 or 8 frames of bees), top it with a queen excluder, if you choose to use one, and, finally, the honey super (the box from which you will collect most of your honey).

The powdered sugar method lets you both count the mites and control them. Sift powdered sugar, 1 cup per brood box, over the tops of the frames and brush it into the hive. The powdered sugar makes the mites lose their grip on the bees and fall off; plus the bees groom the sugar off their bodies, dislodging more mites. Again, use the bottom board to capture the fallen mites. You should not see more than a few mites 10 minutes after dusting. If there are more, you have a problem.

A 24-hour count of a natural mite fall will give you a good idea of a hive’s infestation. Coat the bottom of your Country Rube board with petroleum jelly or cooking spray (to trap the mites), slide it into the lower part of the bottom board, wait for 24 hours, and then pull it out and count the mites. Anything more than 10 mites per brood box indicates you have a problem.
Drone frames will also help trap varroa mites. These frames are designed to encourage bees to make drone comb cells, which are larger than worker comb cells. Since varroa mites prefer drone brood 10 to 1, the drone comb makes a great mite trap. Just before the drones hatch (24 days after the eggs were laid), destroy the drone comb (you can freeze it and return it to the hive, or simply cut it out), and replace the drone frame for the next cycle. (Since our queens have already mated and have a lifetime’s supply of sperm inside of them, they do not need the drones in order to reproduce.) 

We were lucky to collect honey the first summer. Typically, during the first year the bees build up their hive, and if they overwinter well, you can begin harvesting in the late spring or early summer of the second year. Three months after bringing our bees home, we had 4 frames packed with honey, each weighing about 8 pounds. Lacking a professional extractor, we used the following low-tech method. 
1. Cut and crush Using the bench scraper, we cut the honey—wax and all—off the foundation into a bowl, balancing the frame on a wooden spoon set across the bowl like a bridge. Then we used a wooden spoon to crush the honey and wax in the bowl.
2. Straining and settling We poured this slurry of wax and honey through a double layer of cheesecloth and the stainless-steel strainer into our food-grade plastic bucket. Then we left it to drain and settle for a couple of days (bubbles and foam rose to the surface).
3. Bottling We covered the floor with newspapers and got our jars ready. Then we loosened the honey gate (the stopper at the bottom of the bucket) to release the honey into each jar. In went the honey, on went the lids. It was as simple as that. From 4 full frames of honeycomb, we reaped 12 pounds, 10 ounces of honey. We rinsed the leftover wax and froze it. Later, we rendered the wax in a solar wax melter and used it for craft projects like lip balm and hand salve. We had a second surprise harvest later in the summer, bringing our total to about 31 pounds of pure, fragrant honey. 
Packaged bees and caged queen It takes time to build up the colony this way, but it’s the least-expensive choice. You can usually order packaged bees through your local beekeepers’ guild. Preorder as early as the fall and certainly no later than early spring, as bees are only available for a short time in spring.
